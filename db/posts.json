Ante’s portfolio presents a minimalist perspective of nature and human life, often incorporating natural elements like water and sand. For his work, Ante has received accolades such as <em>Top 10 Australian Photography Photographer of the Year 2018</em>, <em>Blow Up Photo Award</em>, <em>Olympus Global Photo Cup Award</em>, and many more.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019863829/Layers-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Layers by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019863829/m%3D900/v2?sig=355fe01f073747f6144027640ea0809bccd300d8c506aa13d0da7bd01349dffb\" alt=\"Layers by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Ante, are you someone who always aspired to be a photographer?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> My parents migrated to Australia from Croatia in the 1960s, and they brought minimal possessions with them. One of the first indulgent items they purchased after establishing themselves was a camera. This camera was handed to me at an early age, and was the start of my photographic journey, which became my creative escape and lifeline.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019720223/Lioness-Hues-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Lioness Hues by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019720223/m%3D900/v2?sig=30cdb7b9de938462ea2a4a0952a5e270e5069a165f612a4111997afbf923dce6\" alt=\"Lioness Hues by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019718585/Lioness-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Lioness by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019718585/m%3D900/v2?sig=195631a5d9fb7f564bb52da47ff38ba57d53eb2efa35a19966e86a3f22075185\" alt=\"Lioness by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: You’ve studied photography academically at schools like Australian National University and RMIT University. How do you feel that your time in these photography programs helped improve your craft?</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Academically, I was equipped with tools and knowledge to help me on a technical level. I had exposure to many genres and methods, which helped me evolve in a professional sense. What I discovered over the years, is that your style, approach, and how you connect and resonate with subjects is something that can’t be taught. It is life’s experiences and your view on the world that shapes you and improves your craft. It is the diverse people you meet that inspire you and help you evolve further creatively and as a human.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019719752/Salt-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Salt by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019719752/m%3D900/v2?sig=3aa4d66cf97b2e5fd6d2627e58952242e928872159a51791c7c0920fded448ba\" alt=\"Salt by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: You’re known for your minimalist approach to photography; what draws you to this particular style?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> My approach is to show the true beauty of the subject, where it demands attention by introducing space and minimizing distractions. The simplest of things, when isolated, can represent something beautiful. The fine details and primitive experiences are becoming rare in contemporary life. I want to celebrate the beauty that is overlooked by creating visuals that offer moments of reflection and appreciation.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019718780/Surface-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Surface by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019718780/m%3D900/v2?sig=5bfa951889631b8cde65bef4b93d9252bd5092ccc010832cca4dc81208467b47\" alt=\"Surface by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Minimalism as a visual movement extends well beyond photography, are there any minimalist artists or pieces you’ve been inspired by?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I’m drawn to simplicity, clean lines, stark contrasts, and, at times, repetition in composition. I am inspired by artists that may not necessarily draw upon these elements frequently, but they are consistent with their style and approach. One inspiration is Photographer and Designer Tom Hegen. His aerial work, which highlights the impact of the human and nature relationship, is an example of work that is not minimal in its purest sense. However, as a body of work, it showcases the beauty of the subjects with repetition, color, textures, and lines.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019720534/Meeting-Landscapes-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Meeting Landscapes by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019720534/m%3D900/v2?sig=27aec6ff14fb94f80200612f1e3e965ac4807f39ac6c4b2a1a14920c94f01743\" alt=\"Meeting Landscapes by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Many of your photos incorporate water and sand, often focusing on the dividing line between them—what attracts you to these recurring elements?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Residing in Sydney and the South Coast of Australia, and with regular trips to the Dalmatian Coast In Croatia, breathtaking beaches and scenes often feature in my work. I am currently working on a series and exhibition titled ‘Elixir’. It celebrates the beauty of water and its connection to life. A reminder of how important it is as a resource and the role it plays on the environment and all living things. More than half of the human body is water, and the reason I naturally gravitate towards it. It embodies calmness, strength, and a sensual force that acts on us physically and emotionally. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019719850/Boy-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Boy by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019719850/m%3D900/v2?sig=e911cb5260d373e78dc2b4a10a51e02f2259745e5e2c23fb05e1ff3db6be3f72\" alt=\"Boy by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Your portfolio includes photos from many different parts of the world; what would you consider the most photogenic location you’ve been to?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> There is no place like home and the connection to your everyday surroundings. For this reason, Australia, and more generally, the East Coast of Australia, I find to be the most photogenic. Exploring your backyard can also sometimes uncover immense beauty that we can easily overlook. My motherland, Croatia, is also home away from home. Since my first visit at the age of two, I have been back more times than I can remember. Its stunning coastline and villages are equally special to me as they hold fond childhood memories. I have captured some of my most personal work there, which continually reminds me of my heritage and the journey my parents embarked on for a better life.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019719312/Dusk-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Dusk by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019719312/m%3D900/v2?sig=7dcd741856557a916ffa968e3db8d8c2d2b3a3c7a28ed28ac1451b7d366f357c\" alt=\"Dusk by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are three things you would consider essential to a successful shoot?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Light, patience, and timing.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019718937/Adriatic-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Adriatic by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019718937/m%3D900/v2?sig=8588d1bbbd57831480b7e58b640c1a5093b7c10dd36a4d8497dfb2d7bc7dd752\" alt=\"Adriatic by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: As someone who has won a number of awards from around the globe, what advice do you have in terms of sourcing, participating, and winning international photography competitions?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Be true to yourself and your creative approach. Get involved with local photographic events to meet and be inspired by other creatives. Growing your network will provide unmeasurable opportunities to not only improve your craft, but also share your work, obtain feedback, and recognition. Explore the 500px Quests regularly, and research photographic industry partners and organizations that provide platforms for accreditation, education, and competitions for emerging and professional artists. Photographic publications also host regular and affiliated awards aligned to major sponsors and leading camera brands such as Olympus.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Creative block is something many artists experience from time to time. Do you have any tips on how to stay inspired?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Have your camera with you at all times and engage with other photographers and visual artists. Delving into ‘behind the scenes’ of other artist’s methods, production, and processes helps me out of any lull. Also, getting involved with workshops and talks will always provide a spark of inspiration.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019719169/Surfer-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Surfer by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019719169/m%3D900/v2?sig=3f22f49cf0fdbf0713f443fceedca2570224eed31ec624f59c37e6a26e8b4318\" alt=\"Surfer by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: If you were to pick one photo you’re most proud of from your 500px Profile, which would it be and why?</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> My ‘<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019719169/Surfer-by-Ante-Badzim/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Surfer</a>’ photo is one that currently feels poignant. Capturing this image in Manyana, on the South Coast of New South Wales, I wanted to portray a sense of calmness and simplicity, allowing the viewer an opportunity to reflect. Isolating subjects presents an opportunity to showcase their beauty. When we bring attention to these simple elements, it can function as a reminder to truly appreciate our surroundings, especially in a time where there is so much uncertainty.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/256695045/Elixir-by-Ante-Badzim\" alt=\"Elixir by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/256695045/m%3D900/v2?sig=efe26c50177fb8649e559f266b934fb12bacc85d089f7cd417644df1e90d79d5\" alt=\"Elixir by Ante Badzim on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?

      "content": "\n<p>Decades ago, as the story goes, two photography legends—Henri Cartier-Bresson and William Eggleston—were seated at the same table at a dinner party in Paris. In many ways, Cartier-Bresson represented the old school of photography, one that preferred the elegance of black and white to color. Eggleston, on the other hand, represented the new generation, who embraced vivid color. </p>\n<p>As you might expect, the conversation that night eventually turned to the “black and white versus color” debate. Cartier-Bresson made it clear he wasn’t a fan of color, and Eggleston politely excused himself and left the table. </p>\n<p>As the years passed, both photographers made an indelible mark on the history of photography—and, in many ways, their differences seem beside the point. After all, Cartier-Bresson’s work left a lasting impression on Eggleston and continued to influence him for a long time. </p>\n<p>In hindsight, we know that there’s enough room for color, black and white, and every style in between—online, in galleries, and on magazine covers. For today’s photographers, the answer to the question “black and white <em>or</em> color?” has become “black and white <em>and</em> color.” Even if most initially learn to shoot in color, figuring out how to work with black and white is a rite of passage and essential skill, both from a technical and creative point of view. </p>\n<p>Here are our top tips for getting started with black and white photography. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/237023965/Game-by-Caner-Baser\" alt=\"Game by Caner Baser on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/237023965/m%3D900/v2?sig=911916d9152e97fc2baf6845ffa8f0b4bbedc7455fda3959396d5d9bb336243e\" alt=\"Game by Caner Baser on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tailor your approach</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to convert any color photo to black and white on the computer, but there’s no guarantee it’ll look good, as some images just don’t “translate” well into black and white. When venturing into black and white, you’ll want to learn to “see” in black and white; that is, look for pure blacks, pure whites, and all the shades of gray in between. If you don’t have all those different values, your photo might end up looking flat and lifeless. </p>\n<p>You might not be able to create the same photos in black and white that you would normally take in color, and that’s okay. Embrace those differences; light and texture, for example, can take on new significance when you’re shooting in black and white, so lean into that. Rather than converting every photo to black and white, save it for when it’s appropriate.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/208125283/Samia-Loki-by-Sterling-Batson\" alt=\"Samia Loki by Sterling Batson on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/208125283/m%3D900/v2?sig=e3cf23e0370d72fe052eb37fe9e054bdbbd8c6fbb008e69a20622590b6800f97\" alt=\"Samia Loki by Sterling Batson on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Train your eye</h2>\n<p>Consider grabbing a <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/330726-REG/Tiffen_BWVF_1_Black_and_White.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">contrast viewing filter</a> to see the world as your camera or film sees it, and seek moments in real life that’ll look great in black and white. At the same time, study how street photographers like Henri Cartier-Bresson use areas of dark, light, and gray. Pour through the archive of Ansel Adams to see how he used grayscale to highlight the tones and textures of the natural world, without losing detail. Spend an afternoon watching black and white films. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1009317255/Bunny-Hop-by-Betina-La-Plante\" alt=\"Bunny Hop by Betina La Plante on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1009317255/m%3D900/v2?sig=b8a359fa9a1377ea7e0777a9f3e227fa7c2ad7e2b3296b6aa9d7dfa97d9765be\" alt=\"Bunny Hop by Betina La Plante on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Be wary of monochrome mode</h2>\n<p>Most digital cameras make it easy to shoot entirely in black and white by switching to “monochrome mode,” but relying too heavily on this feature can be a mistake if it limits your choices in post-processing. That’s because photos shot in monochrome mode save as jpegs, not RAW files, and those contain less information and, therefore, less flexibility for editing. </p>\n<p>To solve this issue, shoot in color (always RAW) on your digital camera and then convert it in post. You can still preview in black and white, as you’ll keep the data from your sensor so long as you’re shooting in RAW. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1005315544/Years-by-charles--lafrance\" alt=\"Years. by charles  lafrance on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1005315544/m%3D900/v2?sig=a2e117210effddf24a16ed1dd6f8984f48464dde6a67e433bfc6e1782184b2bf\" alt=\"Years. by charles  lafrance on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Start with a low ISO</h2>\n<p>This tip is mainly for digital photographers, as high-speed film can produce nice grain that works to your advantage. <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/what-is-iso-and-how-to-use-it-in-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As we know</a>, however, using a high ISO when shooting digitally will result in noise, especially in the shadows. Because shadows are essential in black and white photography, you want to keep them as deep and clear as possible, so start with ISO 100 and go up only if you must. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/20272805/Damp-II-Baltic-Sea-Germany-2012-by-Stefanie-Loges\" alt=\"Damp II, Baltic Sea, Germany 2012 by Stefanie Loges on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/20272805/m%3D900/v2?sig=a08050298b57579f07aa0945b4847ac5bdfabe458fe8fa1f142ecd83d4eee379\" alt=\"Damp II, Baltic Sea, Germany 2012 by Stefanie Loges on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Slow down</h2>\n<p>There’s a reason Ansel Adams regularly worked 18-hour days: timeless, transcendent black and white photos take time. If you’re used to relying on color to capture and guide the eye, the challenge lies in using lines, forms, and compositional elements to create the same effect. </p>\n<p>With black and white, the simplest, clearest solution is usually the best. You often hear black and white photographers use the word “essence” for this reason; it’s all about distilling the elements in your photos down to just the essentials. </p>\n<p>Consider, for instance, Edward Weston’s <em>Pepper No. 30</em>, With deliberate lighting and careful composing, Weston stripped the pepper down to its lines and curves, elevating it from vegetable to art object. It also took him several days to do it, so don’t rush yourself. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1007421132/Birds-on-snow-by-Vahid-Yavari\" alt=\"Birds on snow by Vahid Yavari on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1007421132/m%3D900/v2?sig=7622af95ffcd965de58f2702da3e4ac7a22efbbcf34d0bc258ddf3b7b697021d\" alt=\"Birds on snow by Vahid Yavari on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Plan for the weather</h2>\n<p>Because contrast and light are so critical for black and white photography, it helps to watch the forecast and plan your shoots accordingly. If, for example, you want soft lighting and a range of middle-grays, an overcast day might work best (snow will also flatten the light), while a bright sunny one could be perfect for heavy contrast. There’s no “right” or “wrong” weather for black and white photography, but any choice you make will determine the overall look and mood of your photo.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1017828986/One-direction-by-Inge-Schuster\" alt=\"One direction by Inge Schuster on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1017828986/m%3D900/v2?sig=69a3e089381ee53f367268567e9613d2ab81c8aa7b5e6e18792fd40a1c5e1236\" alt=\"One direction by Inge Schuster on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Play with filters</h2>\n<p>Filters aren’t essential anymore, like they were in the days of film, but they’re still valuable. Using a color filter will darken or brighten certain areas of your images; for example, a red filter will make your reds brighter and your blues/greens darker, while a neutral density filter will block the light overall, allowing you to create longer exposures (say, for landscapes). You can even use a polarizing filter to make your skies darker, so get creative with it. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/237255599/catalinas-world-by-raquel-chicheri\" alt=\"catalina´s world by raquel chicheri on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/237255599/m%3D900/v2?sig=7d6518a1b636db5508b9ccd7ec1e4ffb76d0bad59c0b5210bc49e137ecaed39e\" alt=\"catalina´s world by raquel chicheri on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Find the shadows</h2>\n<p>Without the distraction of color, deep shadows can pull and direct the eye, create patterns, evoke an emotion, and tell a story. This tip ties back to the importance of contrast in black and white; if you can find those points where shadow meets light, you’ll get those nice, clear lines. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/170946055/Risky-Journey-by-Hasan-Murad\" alt=\"Risky Journey by Hasan Murad on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/170946055/m%3D900/v2?sig=3c3e62761879c6b94ba8d6263c198611935cb2fad5a32a804cd603d645038b15\" alt=\"Risky Journey by Hasan Murad on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Watch the contrast</h2>\n<p>Contrast is key for any black and white photo, as you want the whites to be bright and the blacks to be dark, but you (probably) also want to have all those middle-grays as well. Beginning photographers sometimes tend to boost the contrast a bit too far in post-processing, so be wary of overdoing it.</p>\n<p>A good way to check if you have too much contrast is by checking areas in your photo with a lot of detail; if it’s too contrasty, those nuances will be lost. Your post-processing software will also give you a heads-up if you’re clipping your highlights and shadows, so watch those warnings. You can also keep your histogram open throughout to understand how your adjustments affect the tonal range of your photo. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/100003427/Lonely-by-Eugene---Kukulka\" alt=\"Lonely by Eugene   Kukulka on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/100003427/m%3D900/v2?sig=bb7092b14e856a24a8a219d833d6ef48d58452b10d165502883d23cf5f9218bb\" alt=\"Lonely by Eugene   Kukulka on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Adjust the colors</h2>\n<p>Remember when we warned against the dangers of only shooting monochrome jpegs? One reason is that even though you won’t “see” the colors in your final converted image, it helps to pay attention to them during post-processing. Even an adjustment to your white balance, temperature, and tint can have a profound effect on the various tones and contrasts in your photo. </p>\n<p>When you open your RAW file on the computer, resist the urge to convert it to grayscale with a single “click”—or by simply lowering the saturation to -100. Photoshop can do an okay job of guessing what looks good, but you’re likely to do a better job yourself. </p>\n<p>Working with a “channel mixer” or “black and white” adjustment layer will almost always produce stronger images than a “quicker fix.” The latter works by allowing you to go into every color and finesse those tones; for example, if green trees appear too dark, you can pull your green slider to the right to correct it. Does the sky look too light? Move the blue slider a bit to the left. It’s also non-destructive, so you won’t make any mistakes you can’t fix. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/199889927/Eska-by-Nata-AbashidzeRomanovskaya\" alt=\"Eska by Nata Abashidze-Romanovskaya on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/199889927/m%3D900/v2?sig=c6da964943e14df770a46f686cb9e6d7f43b89690ac17003f05ad151396c1907\" alt=\"Eska by Nata Abashidze-Romanovskaya on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Dodge and burn</h2>\n<p>Dodging and burning are two of the first tools you learn in the darkroom, whether you’re using cut-out card shapes or your own hands to block or expose certain areas to light. You can do the same thing in Photoshop (or a comparable software) to darken or lighten areas of your images, depending on where you want to direct the eye. There’s no rule that says you <em>have</em> to have pure white and pure black in every shot, but they do help your photos “pop” off the screen. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/303678319/Untitled-by-Pedro--D%C3%ADaz-Molins\" alt=\"Untitled by Pedro  Díaz Molins on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/303678319/m%3D900/v2?sig=b14a0332e519c73446b4b27305910149d9ef9c17c52b85ab13d7769c3ea4feaf\" alt=\"Untitled by Pedro  Díaz Molins on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Get back to basics</h2>\n<p>Most of our tips here refer to digital cameras, but black and white was born during the film era, so you can always use an old-fashioned black and white film camera to start. You can get a Pentax K1000, for example, for close to $100; this is the perfect camera for learning to “see” in black and white, getting comfortable with manual controls, and developing and printing your work in a darkroom. Grab some Ilford film and paper, and experiment. Even if you later switch to digital (which will give you more options!), you’ll have a solid foundation to start. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/black-and-white-photography/\">Black &amp; white photography | 12 top tips for beginners</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/report-number-of-people-taking-photos-swells-8-fold-in-10-years-67124\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">market research</a>, the number of people taking photographs around the world increased by 800% between 2005 and 2015, due in large part to the prevalence of smartphones. Today, smartphones are more powerful, mirrorless technology is better, and editing tools are smarter, making photography more accessible than ever before. </p>\n<p>These days, it doesn’t necessarily cost thousands of dollars to start a photography practice; it just takes passion, perseverance, and a willingness to learn. Plus, with photography consistently <a href=\"https://www.ypulse.com/article/2019/04/23/most-of-gen-z-millennials-top-20-hobbies-are-offline/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ranking</a> among the top hobbies among millennials and Gen Zers, the number of educational articles, podcasts, and online courses continues to grow, making information readily available at our fingertips. </p>\n<p>Here are our top tips for taking your pictures to the next level, no matter where you are in your photography journey. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018302728/Pastel-Beauty-by-Jovana-Rikalo\" alt=\"Pastel Beauty by Jovana Rikalo on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018302728/m%3D900/v2?sig=01dda45ff3f8216a88181fbb6c6baeb970870d89526fd670c8fe2982894025c5\" alt=\"Pastel Beauty by Jovana Rikalo on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Create an inspiration board</h2>\n<p>Great photographers consume tons of images, so start a collection of images you admire. You can pull from 500px, use magazine clippings, pursue classic photo books, browse museum archives—the more, the merrier. </p>\n<p>Once you have a solid collection, start asking yourself if you notice any patterns. For instance, do you prefer shots with motion blur or a shallow depth of field? Do you prefer soft, natural lighting or bold, artificial alternatives? Before you even pick up the camera, you should have an idea of your taste and creative aspirations. </p>\n<h2>Say “goodbye” to auto</h2>\n<p>You don’t have to jump straight into manual mode, but getting off of automatic mode is the first step towards having more creative control over your images. Even a semi-automatic mode like Aperture or Shutter Priority can do wonders, so study up on the exposure triangle (<a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/aperture-in-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aperture</a>, <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/shutter-speed-in-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shutter speed</a>, and <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/what-is-iso-and-how-to-use-it-in-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ISO</a>), and start practicing your manual adjustments. </p>\n<p>It might be harder at first to get that perfect exposure, but making mistakes—and learning why they happened and how you can correct them—is an invaluable part of the process. If you end up with motion blur, for instance, you’ll know you need a faster shutter speed; if there’s too much noise, you’ll have to decrease your ISO. </p>\n<p><em>Note: It’s also a good idea to try bracketing; that is, take a few photos, exposed slightly differently, to ensure you get at least one proper exposure.</em> </p>\n<p>Don’t forget your <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/introduction-to-white-balance/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">white balance</a> and color temperature either; your camera won’t always get it right without your help. This step is especially important when you’re working with portraits and skin tones. When in doubt, bring a gray card on set just in case. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1017334908/Isolation-by-Dina-Belenko\" alt=\"Isolation by Dina Belenko on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1017334908/m%3D900/v2?sig=e6772dbac23a2f595e11726bcd93c98377e0aeafe0988c5a497f204ff03599f6\" alt=\"Isolation by Dina Belenko on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Try a few lenses</h2>\n<p>Your choice of lens, whether it’s a wide-angle or a telephoto, will significantly influence your composition, cropping, and overall vision of the scene in front of you. Your kit lens will only take you so far. A 35mm or “nifty fifty” lens is always a good choice to start, and if you can, invest in an interchangeable lens camera so you can experiment with a few options. The ability to switch between lenses depending on your subject and setting will give you more control over the artistic process. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018258146/Round-dance-by-Julia-Wimmerlin\" alt=\"Round dance by Julia Wimmerlin on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018258146/m%3D900/v2?sig=249181bb72ee814120d11e02432d8de439bf000c9cefbb3439716e0b73c6474f\" alt=\"Round dance by Julia Wimmerlin on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Play with light modifiers</h2>\n<p>You’d be surprised how much you can do with natural light, given you have a reflector and a diffuser. Even homemade options like reflective surfaces and window curtains will work. Learn how to work with one light source (a window or door), and bounce or soften it as you see fit. The golden hour just after sunrise and before sunset provides soft, warm light that’s perfect for everything from portraits to still lives. </p>\n<h2>Invest in an external flash</h2>\n<p>Once you’re ready to introduce artificial light sources, you’ll want to get an external flash rather than relying on a built-in camera flash for one simple reason: you can move it around and bounce it off the wall and ceiling for softened shadows and a more natural feel. No one wants flat lighting or red eyes. For more control, you can also switch to manual mode to adjust the power of your flash. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1017761916/terraccota-by-Renat-ReneeEll\" alt=\"terraccota by Renat Renee-Ell on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1017761916/m%3D900/v2?sig=71d56de6e64836ef9ef2264ddca026be3680a7401e7e71bdcd0ddd2d4778545b\" alt=\"terraccota by Renat Renee-Ell on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Declutter your background</h2>\n<p>A simple, seamless paper background can go a long way towards making your photos look more professional, and you can find them at any major camera store. Even if you’re shooting on location, it’s still important to watch your background. You want to have enough negative space around your subject to create some “breathing room.”</p>\n<p>For silhouettes, a bright sky works well, while opening up your aperture can create a nice blurred background for portraits. Walls and buildings can also do the trick. The key is to look out for any distracting elements, like a tree branch or a wire, and eliminate them from your composition by moving around. Watch your corners especially, as objects at the edges of your frame carry more visual weight than those close to the center. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1020073748/Puna-by-Giorgia-Cinelli\" alt=\"Puna by Giorgia Cinelli on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1020073748/m%3D900/v2?sig=61dd38cd9c8aa8501ee6e36c28e17d68ae215ba5409914d95d54af568bb9635f\" alt=\"Puna by Giorgia Cinelli on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Learn how to pose your models</h2>\n<p>Stiff poses rarely look good, so get your models relaxed and moving. Authentic gestures and honest expressions are crucial here. Instead of telling someone to smile, tell a joke; instead of asking them to assume a difficult or rigid position, have them stretch, walk around, and try new things. For some easy ideas, check out <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/best-model-poses/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our guide to posing friends</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1017866951/suspicious--by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"suspicious  by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1017866951/m%3D900/v2?sig=2fe9f4fb0817fb35a7b05bebd1edfdca8639727d71d32f1031412446cbe70b73\" alt=\"suspicious  by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Bend your knees</h2>\n<p>Beginning photographers sometimes make the mistake of shooting only from eye level, but it can help to change your perspective by going on your tiptoes or crouching down. With children and animals especially, you’ll want to get down to their eye level for compelling photos, so don’t be afraid to sit, kneel, or move around. You can also bring a step ladder for a higher vantage point. There are so many more compositions and perspectives to consider outside of the obvious and routine. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1017565073/Bokod-Lake-by-Iza-?yso?\" alt=\"Bokod Lake by Iza ?yso? on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1017565073/m%3D900/v2?sig=90dbb48914bafdafaa4274483148c509408c69b3743e0cb1cac2abf0db5ced77\" alt=\"Bokod Lake by Iza ?yso? on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Play with grids (or don’t)</h2>\n<p>Using a rule of thirds grid or golden ratio overlay can help you compose your images better, but they remain a somewhat controversial technique because they can be limiting. There’s no harm in using them as a general guide, especially if you’re in the habit of placing your subjects smack dab in the center of your frame, but remember to keep an open mind and trust your gut as well. There’s no one “formula” for a great shot. The more you shoot, the better your instincts will become. </p>\n<h2>Use the color wheel</h2>\n<p>In the past, we’ve discussed the <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/color-theory-photographers-introduction-color-wheel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fundamentals of color theory</a> and the <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/powerful-photos-with-complementary-colors/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use of complementary colors</a>, so keep those principles in the back of your mind while planning a shoot. You can create bold contrast, for instance, by pairing orange and blue, or you can create harmony by using blues in conjunction with greens and blue-greens. Your color styling choices, whether you’re a food or portrait photographer, will determine the overall look and feel of your shoot. </p>\n<h2>Make your own presets</h2>\n<p>Lightroom presets make it easy and quick to edit and polish your images in post, and while you can find tons of <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/best-lightroom-presets-for-photographers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">great options online</a>, your best bet is to <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/how-to-make-and-sell-lightroom-presets/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">make your own</a>. That way, you’ll learn how the different sliders and adjustments work, deepening your understanding of the editing process overall. Once you start to create edits you love, save them as a personal preset pack that you can apply whenever you wish. </p>\n<p><em>Note: Shoot in RAW, as opposed to JPEG, so you get as much info as possible—and more freedom to edit—from your original files.</em> </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019904548/Were-the-smart-working-generation-by-Davide-Angelini\" alt=\"We're the smart working generation by Davide Angelini on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019904548/m%3D900/v2?sig=f9c836f1395207c80e86fd7043abc88be494100cae5cb21b84e9c8b1c8695a76\" alt=\"We're the smart working generation by Davide Angelini on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>View your photos at 100%</h2>\n<p>A simple but effective tip: examine your photo as large as possible on your computer to catch any noise issues, chromatic aberrations, or focus issues. Go in and fix the mistakes that are fixable, and learn from the ones that aren’t. </p>\n<h2>Use the gear you have</h2>\n<p>You’ve heard it before: more professional gear means more professional photos. Of course, megapixels, frame rates, and ISO performance do make a difference, but they’re not the most important factors. Before you upgrade, master what you already have, even if it’s an older model camera. Don’t let an absence of amazing gear keep you from practicing and honing your skill. You’ll know when you grow out of your camera when you hit a wall creatively. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019299562/DS-350--Sofia-by-Dariane-Sanche\" alt=\"DS 350 - Sofia by Dariane Sanche on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019299562/m%3D900/v2?sig=2bd3cb996d8ddcb0403f48edea05870f8c39d31a9d3764b0bc32a7e84dbd972c\" alt=\"DS 350 - Sofia by Dariane Sanche on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Edit ruthlessly</h2>\n<p>In the days of film, you paid for every frame you took; more photos meant more film, and more film meant more money. But luckily, digital photography has enabled us to create a virtually unlimited number of images. The ability to shoot more often means we learn more quickly, but it also means that we end up with a lot of images that aren’t up to par. The trick here is being critical and objective about your own work; do an initial edit, leave them for a few days, and then keep only your best work. </p>\n<p>We don’t mean you have to delete the images that aren’t good enough, as you might use them down the road, but do keep them in a separate folder. It can also help to ask a peer or colleague you trust to look at your work with fresh eyes. Pro photographers don’t nail it every time—in fact, they might end up with tons of photos they never use—but they do curate their work carefully to meet their exacting standards.</p>\n<h2>Print your photos</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/20160511-corp-2016-photo-trends/20160511-corp-2016-photo-trends\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inaugural Photography Trends</a> Study by Canon, 64% of consumers say that they are likely or somewhat likely to print their photos after taking them. Printing your photos will help to develop your eye, making it easier to spot mistakes and milestones alike. Plus, there’s nothing like holding a professional print—or hanging it up at home—to inspire you to continue taking pictures. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?

Hope it helps.</p>\n<h3><b>Your Free Printable Wedding Photo Checklist. Read below for detailed actionable tips for each part of the checklist: </b></h3>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b>What is wedding photography?</b></h3>\n<p>Wedding photography is the photography of activities related to weddings. It incorporates a mix of genres of photography including portraits, family and group photography, documentary, boudoir, event, and close up shots.</p>\n<p>The wedding photography trend dates back to Victorian England (circa 1885), but these days, it’s a whole new ball game. While most couples don’t know exactly what they want, they will still have high expectations. A brief and perfunctory shot list won’t cut it anymore; this generation of wedding photographers have to capture it all—without missing a beat.</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://go.weddingwire.com/newlywed-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> on WeddingWire, an estimated 90% of couples hire a professional photographer for their weddings. That makes photographers the most in-demand wedding vendor of them all—beating out venues (86%), hair and makeup (80%), and wedding dresses (78%).</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/272321665/m%3D900/v2?sig=f042e0fa556ce931475f996873ba769a899fc8b23c3e5006f233054b78c557a4\" alt=\"C o U p L e by Lee Shin on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b>Wedding photography business</b></h3>\n<p>This is probably one of the most stressful areas of photography. If you accidentally delete a photo or lose the memory card, you are in trouble. But if you take great photos, you are a hero to the clients and are able to get referrals. Experienced wedding photographers can charge a lot for their services and make a lot of money.</p>\n<p>As a professional wedding photographer, a substantial amount of time is spent meeting, listening, and understanding your clients’ needs and wants before the wedding day.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/307467731/m%3D900/v2?sig=e03d1e0f9f87e072e27a699b8c894c08f780b133a9180e7f0166a4bf71683be6\" alt=\"Wedding photography - BNO by Bruno Cervera on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/photography-business-advice-i-wish-id-known-as-a-newbie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wedding photography business advice I wish I’d known as a newbie</a></b></h3>\n<p>Wedding photography is definitely one of the most stressful yet fulfilling areas to be in as a photographer. Being a wedding photographer is a dream for many to aspire to, but like all types of businesses, not everyone can make it past year one, and some don’t get off the ground running. That being said, it’s not impossible.</p>\n<p>As a wedding photographer, your clients tend to have high expectations because it’s more than one day for them, it’s about a lifetime of memories. It is about capturing moments, emotions, and letting your client relive the day with beautiful photos. It’s about the smiling moments that your client never knew happened because they were so busy on their day, about seeing the emotions on the faces of their family and friends, and the visual story that they will treasure forever.</p>\n<p>If you can remember this, you can make it as a wedding photographer.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/69415869/m%3D900/v2?sig=5fe9fc785c2c66c4dde300a52a62f1e6836e3055358ff9f38410a0d63e4d7526\" alt=\"Closer by Brock Petrie on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/video-the-top-8-pitfalls-of-shooting-weddings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top pitfalls of shooting weddings</a></b></h3>\n<p>Most complications usually arise from the business side instead of the photography side. Deciding on a price, what to include in your wedding photography package, and asking the right questions prior to the shoot all play an important part in setting up and running your business.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s managing your time correctly or speaking to your clients, things don’t always go as planned. When it comes to common mistakes, there tend to be two kinds—avoidable mistakes and unavoidable mistakes. The avoidable mistakes are the ones that could have been avoided if you had asked a few questions or done some planning. The unavoidable mistakes are the ones that happen because of something that there was no way to plan for.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1001269654/m%3D900/v2?sig=3504fc21e63359025bdef52a89e7a2102905997b01a7e443ddbcb37713452d60\" alt=\"Wedding photography - La cérémonie est terminée by Cédric Nicolle on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b>How much do I charge for wedding photography?<b></b></b></h3>\n<p>Wedding photography prices depend on many factors like location, coverage length (time), number of shooters, products included in the package, brand name of the photography, experience, and marketing skills.</p>\n<p>In general, according to <a href=\"https://www.weddingwire.com/cost/wedding-photographer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wedding Wire</a>, prices in the US tend to range from $1150 and $3000, with the average wedding photography cost being around $2000. This will likely compromise of 12 percent of the overall wedding budget. This is a significant percentage of the average wedding budget, which makes sense because of the investment in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/284284023/m%3D900/v2?sig=e043d66b76e85c038e1efcea2e908b432a787589646905a56a6c13906eb5f78f\" alt=\"Wedding photography - The moment by Melli &amp; Shayne on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/7-fun-creative-wedding-and-engagement-photo-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 fun and creative wedding and engagement photo ideas</a></b></h3>\n<p>It’s important for the engaged couple to commemorate this occasion with romantic photos. But not all of them know exactly where to start. One thing for sure is that it’s important for the couple have an engagement shoot that turns out one-of-a-kind and feels right to them. There are a lot of cheesy and predictable photos out there, and it’s important to have a creative and fun array of wedding photo ideas for your couple to make it unique. Before you jump into the engagement shoot, here’s what you should talk to your clients to make it fun and one-of-a-kind.</p>\n<h3><b>Location</b></h3>\n<p><strong>The couple’s favorite spot:</strong> Visit the couple’s favorite coffee shop where everyone knows both of them. Or a brewery where they meet for happy hour every week? Use these spots that are just theirs as inspiration for a great engagement shoot and to help them save memories of these places.</p>\n<p><strong>The couple’s next vacation: </strong>If the couple is planning on traveling together, this is an exciting time to take photos of them. The hard part would be ensuring you can be where they are or working with another photographer in the region to have an engagement shoot from multiple regions.</p>\n<p><strong>The couple’s first date:</strong> Revisit the spot of their first date together for a few touching shots.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/98012053/m%3D900/v2?sig=98a4fb82aebd620aca99b3086afb34b53ecf285baa564cc6d8a1581cabc7e6a9\" alt=\"First Date by Luke Martin on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/195294109/m%3D900/v2?sig=030e15f154c2b67be23b4c2bcaa22cc6e9126e11ff87b8230b89ee36f2d04161\" alt=\"First date OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA by Chang sik(nanal) Lim on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b>Do your research</b></h3>\n<p>For many couples, traditions play an integral role in the ceremony and reception. Last year, one in five couples incorporated cultural elements into their weddings, paying homage to their heritage and background.</p>\n<p>Read up on the history behind any traditional details or customs you’ll be photographing. In traditional Persian weddings, for example, you might find a Sofreh Aghd, or wedding spread; Indian ceremonies can take place over the course of several days, and Jewish ceremonies can take place under a chuppah, or bridal canopy.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/280773433/m%3D900/v2?sig=2fd483c144abc0ccffa2b412579c15586fb3e696ca2406dc3011725bf546bbf9\" alt=\"Monisha by Girish Balgobin on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/a-step-by-step-beginners-guide-to-photographing-your-first-wedding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A step by step beginner’s guide to photographing your first wedding</a></b></h3>\n<p>If you are nervous about shooting your first wedding photos, or need a refresher on the type of photos to take, we’ve put together a step-by-step guide for you to ease your mind and help you look forward to capturing the couple’s day.</p>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/5-wedding-photography-tips-you-need-to-know-before-shooting-your-first-wedding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tips you need to know before shooting your first wedding </a></b></h3>\n<p>Before you get started, you need to know that being an awesome wedding photographer is not all about photography. Having good photography skills is only about 30% of what it takes to be a fantastic photographer. The other 70% includes the soft skills that are intangible to being client-focused. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being able to smile, knowing people’s names, being genuinely interested in other people, and making an effort to learn how to build rapport with anyone. Clients will choose someone they like over a candidate they don’t enjoy being around, even if they are more talented.</li>\n<li>Being a problem solver when things go wrong (e.g., equipment breaks, family drama arises, etc.)</li>\n<li>Being bold and having the ability to establish common ground with people, so they will want to listen to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/22-photos-of-weddings-around-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weddings around the world</a></b></h3>\n<p>Cultures around the world have their own unique way of saying, “I do.” Some are sweet like in the Czech Republic, where an infant is placed on the couple’s bed to bless and enhance their fertility, while others are a little different, like in Congo, where couples are forbidden to smile on their wedding day.</p>\n<p>Many people are aware of the tossing of the bouquet and the first dance, but are you familiar with the money dance? Money is tossed at or pinned on the couple, as a way for friends and family to support them. There are many ways to say ‘I do.”</p>\n<p>To prepare for a cultural wedding, it’s all about the communication leading up to the event that matters the most. As a photographer, it’s essential to stay in the loop.</p>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/loverly-wedding-photo-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 ways to not mess up your wedding photos</a></b></h3>\n<p>When it comes to great wedding photos, we’ve seen the good and the bad.

A scheduled interview (in person or over the phone) will suffice, but an engagement photoshoot is a natural way to learn more about them. Spurred by social media and wedding websites, these sessions are increasingly popular—and some wedding photographers include them as part of a package deal.</p>\n<p>An engagement shoot presents a great opportunity to get to know the couple, their love story, and—perhaps most importantly—their expectations going forward. Spend some time discussing what exactly they have in mind, and make sure they’ve prepared a shot list of their own so you can add it to yours. 30% of millennials create a Pinterest board for wedding planning, so check and see if they have one they’d like to share.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/275484737/m%3D900/v2?sig=53b47ed23affa663e85559de5b393b2e5935414752e9389956aaebaa6322322e\" alt=\"B&amp;I Wedding - East London - South Africa by Teddy Kubheka on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2><b>Shot list: Before the ceremony</b></h2>\n<p>From zipping up the gown to peering in the mirror, the “getting ready” shots are essential for any bride or groom.

Remember, you only get one chance when it comes to wedding photos, and after it is all over, the photos are the one thing that will stay with your client forever.</p>\n<p>It’s important to capture the myriad of feelings at play in the wedding. When focusing in on these feelings it is helpful to capture moments when your subjects are not looking directly at the camera. Especially if you are planning on submitting any of your wedding photography for Licensing. Buyers prefer to see the bride, groom, or other attendees interacting with their loved ones in those “in-between moments” (e.g, a quick kiss, a private joke, a whispered thought, etc.).</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/175163053/m%3D900/v2?sig=c381133ebec975bd755cd42e25308a0ba464939d4d1e9bdabdc3f3ab8ecf717d\" alt=\" by Allie Wynands on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/25-wedding-photos-to-touch-and-inspire-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25 wedding photos to touch and inspire you</a></b></h3>\n<p>Check out these 25 beautiful wedding photos have been submitted for Licensing.

      "content": "\n<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has closed borders, emptied streets, and halted tourism in traffic-heavy destinations, reshaping the travel industry in the process. From mandatory temperature checks at amusement parks to limited-capacity museums to online reservations and spaced-out arrival times, tourism, as we know it, has changed significantly—and many locations have seen rapid declines. </p>\n<p>For many tourists, however, these changes haven’t necessarily spelled the end of travel but instead encouraged them to stay closer to home; earlier this summer, the booking site Travelocity <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/06/15/11-ways-pandemic-will-change-travel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> that the majority of hotel bookings were within 100 miles of where travelers lived. People are still looking to “get away from it all”—just on a smaller, more domestic scale. </p>\n<p>This trend is likely to continue; according to a spring <a href=\"https://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/media_root/document/MMGY_Research_Week4_Web.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> from the U.S. Travel Association, 43% of travelers said that, post-pandemic, they expect to travel to destinations closer to home. As people forgo vacations and instead revamp their homes with pools or patios, experts <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/home-depot-best-buy-staycation-era-a-permanent-shift-trader-says.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> we’re entering an era of domestic and local travel. Resorts and hotels are adapting by rolling out new ‘staycation’ and even ‘workation’ packages to appeal to the local customer. In Sweden, the latest national craze has become the ‘hemester,’ or a semester-long domestic holiday. </p>\n<p>For commercial photographers, this shift poses unexpected challenges but also new opportunities. As countries and tourist hubs continue to reopen, their marketing approach will change; instead of promoting jam-packed festivals, for instance, many might start using photos of people enjoying getaways in remote, secluded locations. </p>\n<p>In light of the surge in global interest in staycations—and the ever-evolving state of travel—we wanted to share our top tips for creating localized, commercial lifestyle photoshoots that resonate with brands today. Read on to learn more about capturing timely, travel-themed content for your Licensing portfolio, while also illustrating the “new normal” post-pandemic. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/216241219/waterfall-smiles-by-Sam-Brockway\" alt=\"waterfall smiles by Sam Brockway on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/216241219/m%3D900/v2?sig=d7059271aab788482f2d144831836fa27a556e56416ceb6cd576007f6ab28a86\" alt=\"waterfall smiles by Sam Brockway on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tap your local connections</h2>\n<p>Even as tourism begins to open up around the world, travelers will remain wary of overcrowded destinations. That’s where a local photographer shines: you know your hometown better than anyone, and you know those tucked-away spots that the average tourist doesn’t get to see. </p>\n<p>Think: mom-and-pop shops, trendy promenades, that out-of-the-way street food cart. In short, show off what you love most about your town or city, whether it’s an urban lookout or lush landscape. With an eye for detail and an appreciation for local culture, a simple “day-in-the-life” shoot with friends could easily turn into a marketable set of images. </p>\n<p>Start by photographing the parks and leisure areas you frequent yourself, and then reach out to local restaurants to see if they’d be willing to sign a property release to let you shoot there. You always need a release if you plan to shoot on any private property (if it can be identified in your photos), but businesses are often happy to sign one in exchange for free photos to use for their own marketing.  </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/197103351/Torrey-and-Millie-by-Rob-Sese\" alt=\"Torrey and Millie by Rob Sese on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/197103351/m%3D900/v2?sig=6c843ce17089d8a57fcfbb05785a664361f9ca581a3f125d0459a860d0542776\" alt=\"Torrey and Millie by Rob Sese on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Capture the times</h2>\n<p>Many public spaces have instituted new rules and policies, and those are all changes to reflect in your commercial portfolio. Authentic photos of life and travel in the age of COVID-19 might include masks, but they can also incorporate subtle cues like longer, socially-distanced lines outside stores, plastic barriers, and contactless tech. </p>\n<p>When promoting local travel, brands will look for photos that demonstrate their commitment to keeping customers and employees safe, so visualizing these real-world changes can instantly boost the potential of your shoot. For a while, at least, image-buyers are likely to shy away from images that include crowded parks or restaurants. </p>\n<p>“Within each city, the ‘look’ of travel has also changed,” the 500px Content Team tells us. Public transit systems have lost revenue, and many cities have seen a surge in walking and biking. Parks have introduced social distancing signs and circles to keep people safe. These are all ideas for a potential photoshoot that strikes a chord with buyers. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1016135576/Social-Distance-Circles-at-Domino-PArk-by-Jerm-Cohen\" alt=\"Social Distance Circles at Domino PArk by Jerm Cohen on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1016135576/m%3D900/v2?sig=504cc8b404718f7cd000e022e99256d10535dd294ea12fe6351aa35f218ba060\" alt=\"Social Distance Circles at Domino PArk by Jerm Cohen on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Do some digging</h2>\n<p>You know many of the best spots in your city, but sometimes it helps to approach your hometown as you would a faraway destination.

Meanwhile, RV rentals have increased by <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/rv-rentals-coronavirus-americans-vacation/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">650%</a>, and a study from rental company RVshare showed that 65% of respondents wanted to be surrounded by nature. In <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/07/03/lifting-lockdowns-innovating-against-covid-and-staycation-trends\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Italy</a>, travelers have opted to hike and have embraced eco-friendly “staycations.” </p>\n<p>Camping and cottaging are also popular. According to reports, 20% of users of Kampgrounds of America are first-time campers, with <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/2020/08/how-to-go-camping-during-covid/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>National Geographic</em></a> recommending trips to lesser-known destinations like Lake Clark or The Great Basin. These days, people can even book camping adventures using the popular website Hipcamp, which has unsurprisingly noticed a significant reduction in the distances people are traveling from home. </p>\n<p>Part of visualizing travel right now means incorporating these outdoor settings and activities, where people can easily maintain a safe social distance. Bring out your telephoto lens, ask friends and family members to take on the role of models, and drive to a local park or plan a road trip; as a bonus, you’re unlikely to need a property release if you’re shooting on public property. </p>\n<p>A quick note on property releases: They don’t only apply to photos shot on private property, as intellectual property is also protected. That means that if you’re photographing a landmark, a building by a renowned architect, brand signage, or a work of street art, you need a release, or you need to find a way to shoot it without giving away the location (<a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/tips-and-tricks-licensing-photos-troublesome-locations/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check out our article on photographing troublesome locations here</a>). You don’t want to spend your time photographing an identifiable building only to realize that the photo isn’t licensable. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/285970767/Active-senior-man-with-electrobike-cycling-outdoors-in-town-by-Jozef-Polc\" alt=\"Active senior man with electrobike cycling outdoors in town. by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/285970767/m%3D900/v2?sig=cdf7eb98650949c94ec9f1fdc4773a87ffb388b0377eef36e39dd636a4a1194d\" alt=\"Active senior man with electrobike cycling outdoors in town. by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Embrace new trends</h2>\n<p>Changing times also mean new possibilities; as fresh trends emerge within the travel industry, brands will continue to search for photos that reflect them. Private rentals, vacation homes, and villas are taking precedence over hotels, and many travelers are choosing to take longer trips while working remotely. </p>\n<p>Weekend road-trips are also popular choices; in New Zealand, for instance, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-asia-tourism/with-coronavirus-under-control-vietnam-and-new-zealand-see-different-travel-trends-idUSKBN23W3L4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">encouraged</a> citizens to experience their “own backyards” and employers to consider four-day work weeks. As we’ve seen in Italy, mass tourism is out, and people are taking a more eco-conscious, environmentally friendly approach to travel. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/252088005/tub-shoes-by-Sam-Brockway\" alt=\"tub shoes by Sam Brockway on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/252088005/m%3D900/v2?sig=92a6399e90668ec69a7fdbf424c6af7d0384f0be77b1b5766ed0949068b7f290\" alt=\"tub shoes by Sam Brockway on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Go solo</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/whats-trending-licensing-travel-photography-freedom-solo-travel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Solo travel</a> has been trending in commercial photography for a while now, and this movement is likely to continue, as activities like golf and hiking take precedence over movie theaters, malls, and other tourist attractions. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stocks-buy-staycation-coronavirus-supported-stay-home-bank-america-2020-6-1029339488\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Credit card data</a> suggests that people are spending more on solitary leisure activities, including trail running and marine adventures.

      "content": "\n<p>Instagram photos look best at 1080 pixels wide. Pinterest images shine at around 1000×1500 pixels. A Facebook photo should be at least 1200 pixels wide—1920 if it’s an event photo. In 2003, when 500px launched, the perfect web-resolution was, well, 500 pixels. Now, it’s best to upload your photos with a resolution of at least 2048 pixels. </p>\n<p>The web is constantly evolving, and for photographers, that means regular image resizing. While you can resize your photos using a variety of quick online tools, we recommend doing it with care and precision so you don’t damage the quality of your files. Here are our tips for resizing your images without losing any details in the process. </p>\n<h3><strong>Knowing the vocabulary</strong></h3>\n<p>First, it’s important to understand the terms that will be used in this article.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dimension</strong></h4>\n<p>The dimension of a photo is essentially the measurement of its length and width. Depending on what you’re using your photo for, you may need to see this measurement in pixels, inches, or centimeters. There are many standard sets of dimensions that you’re probably familiar with; for example, your old family photo albums are probably full of standard 4×6 inch prints.</p>\n<h4><strong>Resolution (Pixel Density)</strong></h4>\n<p>The resolution of a photo refers to how many pixels there are within those dimensions. (Therefore, the pixel density of the photo.) The smaller those pixels, the more of them you can fit within your dimensions and, in most cases, the sharper your image will appear. </p>\n<h4><strong>DPI and PPI</strong></h4>\n<p>DPI (Dots Per Inch) and PPI (Pixels Per Inch) are the two terms that describe your image resolution. Although you may hear them used interchangeably, DPI refers to print resolution (as in, the number of ink dots per inch) while PPI refers to screen resolution (or how many pixels in an inch when your photo is viewed at 100%). </p>\n<h4><strong>File Size</strong></h4>\n<p>File size refers to how much space or memory your photo takes up. The more information there is in an image, the more memory it requires, and the bigger the file size. “Information” can refer to pixels, which means a higher resolution may give you a larger file, or it can refer to things like layers if you are saving in a non-destructive file type.</p>\n<h4><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></h4>\n<p>Aspect ratio is often confused with dimension because they’re closely related. Your dimension, as we just discussed, describes the length and width of your image in terms of measurements. Your aspect ratio describes that length and width in terms of—you guessed it—a ratio. Those 4×6 inch family photos we just talked about have an aspect ratio of 3:2. </p>\n<h3><strong>Why is resizing images important?</strong></h3>\n<p>Resizing is a daily part of a professional photographer’s workflow. Even if you are not going to print your image, your website or online portfolio will probably have requirements for the file size and resolution that an image must be in order to be uploaded. Depending on where your image will appear, you may want to use a specific aspect ratio (a hero image will require a different aspect ratio than an Instagram post). </p>\n<p>If you do not resize to fit those requirements, the hosting site may refuse to upload it altogether, or worse, compress or distort your photo. The process of resizing the dimensions of a photo and/or changing its resolution and file size to prepare it for the web is called <a href=\"https://french.ly/image-optimization/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">image optimization</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to resize in Photoshop for beginners</strong></h3>\n<p>Resizing in Photoshop is a relatively simple process. Start by going to <strong>Image &gt; Image Size</strong>. </p>\n<p>Here you’ll see all that vocab we just covered. Your file size (Image Size) is right there at the top. Below it are your dimensions. </p>\n<p>If you want to convert pixels to inches or need to do the opposite and convert inches to pixels, simply select a new unit of measurement from one of the dropdown menus on the right. Last is the image resolution, which is measured in PPI or DPI. In theory, you can just set these numbers however you like and click “OK.” In practice, it’s not always that easy. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image001.png\" alt=\"An image being resized in Photoshop\" width=\"1418\" height=\"783\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-37590\" srcset=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image001.png 1418w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image001-500x276.png 500w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image001-768x424.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1418px) 100vw, 1418px\"></p>\n<p>Above, we’re resizing <a href=\"https://web.500px.com/photo/197149709/Forest-Sky-by-Kalen-Emsley/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forest Sky</em></a>, a piece by 500px Contributor <a href=\"https://500px.com/kalen_emsley\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kalen Emsley</a>, as an example. You can see the “Image Size” dialogue box we just described. </p>\n<p>Say you want to increase the resolution, so you type a new number into the resolution box. </p>\n<p>Notice what happens below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image003.png\" alt=\"An image being resized in photoshop\" width=\"1435\" height=\"786\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-37591\" srcset=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image003.png 1435w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image003-500x274.png 500w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image003-768x421.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1435px) 100vw, 1435px\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Resolution, resizing, and resampling</strong></h3>\n<p>Not only has your resolution increased in the image above, but your dimensions have also increased as well. You haven’t actually increased the resolution; you’ve just expanded those pixels out. Imagine you have a stretchy polka-dot shirt. If you lay it flat, the dots are close together. If you stretch it, those dots get farther apart as the edges of the shirt extend further out. That’s how it works with pixels and resizing. </p>\n<p>Because the <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/advanced-cropping-resizing-resampling-photoshop.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resample</a> button is checked in our dialogue box (it will usually be this way by default), Photoshop filled in those pixel gaps for us. But because your computer does not have the actual scene to compare your image to, it can only make an educated guess at what the new pixels should look like. When you resize without resampling, Photoshop will not fill those gaps; it will simply change the resolution to match your resizing.</p>\n<p>That’s how issues like fuzziness occur when you enlarge what was originally a razor-sharp photo and because of that, it’s easier to retain good quality when you’re making an image smaller than when you are making it bigger. However, when you make an image smaller, you may be inadvertently deleting some of that pixel information, which means you might still experience a loss of quality if you try to size back up again. </p>\n<h3><strong>Preserving image quality</strong></h3>\n<p>In the case of this particular photo, the loss of image quality would barely be noticeable since it had a healthy number of pixels to start with. You may find yourself in a position where you have to make changes like this in order to meet an upload or printing requirement with an image, so do two things to keep image degradation from becoming noticeable to the naked eye:</p>\n<p>1. Shoot at a high resolution<br>\nThis way, you give yourself plenty of information to work with in case you ever have to “fudge” the numbers on your resolution in post-processing.</p>\n<p>2. Keep a copy of your original<br>\nIf you ever make a change and later discover that the quality doesn’t hold up the way it appeared to on your editing screen, you can go back to the drawing board with your original pixel density.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to choose the right image size</strong></h3>\n<p>When you are determining how to size your image, start with the dimensions. The first step is to use the correct unit of measurement. If you will be printing your photo, measure in inches or centimeters. This will be especially helpful if you want to mat and/or frame it, as you can simply choose a standard size like 5×7, 8×10, or 11×14 and go from there. </p>\n<p>Remember that different standard sizes have different aspect ratios. So if your image has an aspect ratio of 3:2 (remember, that’s a 4×6 inch photo), you will <a href=\"https://www.digital-slr-guide.com/aspect-ratio.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">experience some cropping</a> if you resize it to an 8×10, which has an aspect ratio of 5:4.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to choose the right image resolution</strong></h3>\n<p>After your in-camera focus settings, your resolution is what ultimately determines the sharpness of your image. The standard for web-based images is 72 PPI (or DPI, depending on who you speak with about it), although many photographers choose to go with 300, which is the standard for a high-resolution print image. </p>\n<p>Now that you’ve learned what to do in Photoshop to resize your images, and how to do it without sacrificing quality, you can easily resize your photography for use on the web or in print. Remember to use the correct resolution for your medium and shoot at a high resolution to allow yourself plenty of flexibility when you are ready to resize. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/pixels-to-inches-resize-image-quality-photoshop/\">Pixels to Inches: How to Resize Images Without Losing Quality in Photoshop</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

When I first picked up a camera and decided to capture some shots of the night sky I could barely see a light at the end of the tunnel. Now, a few months and a few hundred shots later, that light is shining bright and I’m here to share with you the information and experiences I gained along the way.</p>\n<p>But wait, there is one problem, from your vantage point there may be a million and one factors keeping you from seeing the mesmerizing beauty of space or the Milky Way. Most of us live in locations where cloud cover, smog and light pollution are the number one enemy of the night sky photographer. That’s where I come in, armed with my tutorials, presets, and simple tricks you will have all the ammunition necessary to defeat the odds and capture the beauty of space and the galaxy that lies beyond. I do have a few small errands for everyone to run prior to departing on our trip, so grab a sturdy tripod, wide angle lens, a camera with manual mode functionality and your imagination, let’s head for the stars.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n<p><strong>#1</strong> The number one key element to capturing the night sky, Milky Way, or stars in general is having a dark sky, and I mean the darkest sky possible. Please note, if you can’t see the Milky Way with the naked eye, it will be very hard to capture it any better on camera. Here are a few solutions to ensure the best shots possible, first of all check a <a href=\"http://www.blue-marble.de/nightlights/2012\">Light Pollution Map</a>.</p>\n<p><b>#2</b> The next equally important step is checking the moon phase. If there is a moon in the sky, by no means will the stars appear to shine as bright. Our moon is much closer than any of the stars seen in the night sky, therefore it appears to shine much brighter. Shooting on nights of the New Moon ensures that the moon is not visible in the sky and that the Milky Way appears as bright as possible. A great resource for tracking down this information is the <a href=\"http://photoephemeris.com/\">The Photographers Ephemeris</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>#3</strong> The third crucial item is a very sturdy tripod, this is one of the steps that many people miss out on and therefore sacrifice the quality of their star shots. I currently use a Really Right Stuff TVC-34L Versa Series 3 Tripod with BH-55 Ballhead and Nikon D800 L-Bracket and find it to be hands down the best set up out there.</p>\n<p><strong>#4</strong> The 4th and last necessary Item is a camera with manual mode functionality that shoots in RAW format. This allows the user to have ultimate control when capturing the stars and in the post processing environment.. My preferred night star photography camera is the Nikon D800, which handles the high ISO and noise induced from night sky shooting flawlessly. Although it is not necessary, having a camera remote/timer and very fast (wide aperture) wide angle lens will greatly improve the results of your star shots. I shoot with and highly recommend the Nikkor14-24mm f/2.8G and/or Nikkor 16mm f/2.8 Fisheye lens for all my star shots. At f/2.8 they are both VERY fast lenses.</p>\n<h2>Lens &amp; Camera advice</h2>\n<p>If you are looking to get into night star photography and are not sure what kind of camera or lens to select there are a few pointers to keep in mind. First off, if your wallet is deep enough a full frame camera with a 35mm sensor is the best way to capture the night sky, a medium format camera will also work wonders but comes with an even higher price point. When talking full frame sensors a few good ones come to mind. In the world of Canon the 5D Mark II or Mark III will work fine along with the 6D models. There are a few other options such as the Nikon D700 or the D600 on the Nikon side of things. Looking at cameras that do not include a full frame sensor the Canon 7D or the Nikon D5100 will somewhat do the trick, but a full frame camera is really necessary to capture the Milky Way and all it’s stars.</p>\n<p>Moving along to lenses there are a few major points that need to be touched on. Having a lens with an aperture of f/3.5 or faster is absolutely necessary for capturing the Milky Way, for star trails it is not at all necessary. Here are a few great lenses that will work wonders on your full or crop sensor camera. I consider the NIkkor 14-24 F/2.8G wide angle lens to be the best star photography lens on the planet, I use it for 95% of my star shots and it never fails. Another yet cheaper option would be the Rokinon 14mm f/2.8 or the Rokinon 24mm f/1.4. I have also been experimenting with my Nikkor 16mm f/2.8 Fisheye which seems to do a fine job less the insane amount of distortion, which at times can look very cool and out of this world.</p>\n<h2>Step by step to taking night sky photos</h2>\n<p>Head on over to my <a href=\"http://www.davemorrowphotography.com/p/tutorial-shooting-night-sky.html\">Free Star Photography Tutorial</a> and download a free copy of my 500 Rule Chart if you like, we will use it in the following section.</p>\n<p>First off let’s get one thing straight, and then we will move on to some interesting math homework, sounds like fun right? To get successful shots of the Milky Way you will have to have a very visible and clear view of it with your naked eye. If you can’t clearly see it, physics won’t allow you to capture it with your camera without inducing a massive amount of ambient light which will destroy the picture. That takes all the trouble of finding the Milky Way out of the equation, so now your job is to find a really dark spot where you can see it and start shooting using the following steps.</p>\n<p><strong>500 Rule.</strong> Let’s let the math homework begin. OK OK, I’m just kidding the math part has already been taken care of in the form of this chart (provided). And now I introduce to you the 500 Rule. Even though it appears to be quite complicated the concept is simple in theory and crucial to capturing clear star shots.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davemorrowphotography.com/p/tutorial-shooting-night-sky.html\"><img alt=\"Night sky photography - \" src=\"http://static.500px.net.s3.amazonaws.com/support/Blog500px/Tutorials/DMorrow/500Rule.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>No Star Trails.</strong> To prevent star trails, also known as the visible change of the star’s location with respect to our earth’s location over the selected shutter speed, divide the number 500 by the focal length you are planning to shoot at, say 14mm for example, the result is the maximum exposure time for your shot in seconds.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://gp1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/806614/photos/photos.500px.net/11834033/1ff309306e4b813473aef77616d4d77b0775fcc4/4.jpg\" alt=\"Night sky photography - Photograph When Worlds Collide by Dave Morrow on 500px\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/11834033/when-worlds-collide-by-dave-morrow\">When Worlds Collide by Dave Morrow on 500px</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Yes Star Trails.</strong> The great part about the 500 Rule is that it can also work in reverse for the shooter that is looking to capture star trails. For those of you that don’t shoot with full frame cameras it is necessary to take this “Crop Factor” into account when performing the calculation. I have provided standard crop factors for different camera models below. For example a full frame 35mm camera shooting at 16mm can capture the night sky for a maximum of 31 seconds prior to showing any results of “Star Trails” in the picture. Once the exposure time exceeds 31 seconds, trails or star movement will start to show up in the shot. The best way to clearly exhibit this relationship is to go outside and experiment, there are a million different acceptable combinations it’s just a matter of finding what works for you and your camera. My Free Star Photography Tutorial also provides info on this topic.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://gp1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/806614/photos/photos.500px.net/7125752/bdc27a5cd12132121f3e67047e4403a64de0eb2d/4.jpg\" alt=\"Night sky photography - Photograph Come Join Us by Dave Morrow on 500px\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/7125752/come-join-us-by-dave-morrow\">Come Join Us by Dave Morrow on 500px</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Capturing The Right Night Sky Photography Shot</h2>\n<p>Now that a lens and exposure length has been reviewed it’s time to get down to the technical aspects which I will refer to as the Big Three: aperture, ISO and shutter speed.</p>\n<p>I currently shoot my night sky photography shots with a focal length of 14-24mm, ISO ranging from 3000-5000 (depending on your camera these high settings may increase the noise exponentially) and shutter speed of 30 seconds. Keep in mind, a longer exposure picks up more light, which in turn means you will see stars that are farther and farther away from our planet. On the other hand light sources closer to our planet will appear brighter at longer exposure times. It is key to play around with the Big Three: aperture, ISO, and exposure time until the correct setting is achieved. Each of these settings directly reflects on one another, this being said there are many different combinations that will yield great results. The trick is to find out what works best for you and your camera, there is no right or wrong way to do it, just good and bad results.</p>\n<p>Focusing at night can also become difficult. I find it easy to focus at infinity, take a practice shot to see how it looks then adjust focus from there. Usually infinity works just fine. See something you like in the foreground? Take one shot focusing on the stars, then another focusing on the foreground; these can in turn be blended together in Photoshop using layer masks for a sharp &amp; interesting overall image. It is also worth noting that unless I am taking two shots to blend in the stars with my foreground using Photoshop, I only use 1 RAW exposure or file to capture the night sky. Since there is a very minimal range of light, the dynamic range of the image is low and a single exposure will work just fine.</p>\n<h2>Post Processing</h2>\n<p><strong>Lightroom edits.</strong> When it comes to post processing star shots I use a few tools, the first being Lightroom 4. Lightroom can be used for basic RAW file conversion, color correction, basic luminosity control, contrast, sharpening and noise reduction. These can all be performed using the simple slider interface that is provided with the program.</p>\n<p>Experimentation is once again the best way to find the best settings that work for you. To make life a bit easier I also made some <a href=\"http://www.davemorrowphotography.com/p/under-stars-lightroom-4-presets.html\">Under the Stars Lightroom 4 presets</a> that I use to process each one of my star photos. These presets will make the stars come to life and the colors pop with the click of a button.</p>\n<p><strong>Photoshop edits.</strong> Upon completing the noted steps, Photoshop and luminosity masks can be used to achieve ultimate control in bringing out the most in your star shots. Luminosity masking is the technique used in Photoshop to select only certain ranges of light in the picture. This being said its most powerful feature selects the bright stars and allows the user to brighten them, while the remaining darker portions of the photo remain untouched. On the other hand luminosity masks can also be used to allow a noise reduction layer to be applied to only the dark and noisy areas of the photo. Detailed selection and luminosity masking are both intermediate level Photoshop skills that take hours of practice but are well worth the reward!</p>\n<p>After using luminosity masks in Photoshop my post processing is complete and I can save the file for later viewing or sharing on the web. I provide an <a href=\"http://www.davemorrowphotography.com/2012/12/star-photography-post-processing.html\">Under the Star Post Processing Video Tutorial</a> that covers all these steps denoted above in full detail.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://500px.com/DaveMorrow\"><img alt=\"Night sky photography - \" src=\"http://static.500px.net.s3.amazonaws.com/support/Blog500px/Tutorials/DMorrow/David_2.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!

Then,  when my daughter was born, my mind changed completely, and I realized I love how the sunlight “walks” through the windows and makes the room look so different during the day.

Discovering something new to work with and shoot is the best part of my day! I’ve been thinking about this a lot these days—I’ve always worked from home, so I feel like I’ve been in quarantine since 2012.

And, as a curious food lover, I try to find new kinds of vegetables and fruits in the grocery store. I look for fruits and vegetables with colors that will complement or contrast against my backgrounds. Most of my photos are taken with a single flash mounted in the camera, so I have to manage to have fully charged batteries, but overall it is very, very simple.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1020094150/blue-flowers-by-Sarah-Saratonina\" alt=\"blue flowers by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1020094150/m%3D900/v2?sig=c9227ab301c81757f609041a56d0a7b9e595deeb144f9211e59f79ed50aa69c2\" alt=\"blue flowers by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Your photos stand out for your use of bright and vibrant colors, how do you decide which colors to work with within your photos?</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The colors depend on what I am able to find at the grocery store—I kid, I actually make preliminary sketches of the photos I plan on shooting, though most of the time I don’t end up using them.

I feel that they are often too dark and sad, though I do I love the Van Gogh still life paintings. I guess if I was a painter, like Van Gogh, I probably could let the onions grow old and make still life paintings of sprouted onions and other foods too. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1014131767/Little-life-by-Sarah-Saratonina\" alt=\"Little life by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1014131767/m%3D900/v2?sig=45e656969dc42de38052d82e4cf154c858d5b2caccb8501b046f7105aa1f9769\" alt=\"Little life by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are some of the challenges of capturing great still life photos?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I find it can be challenging to always be creative and bring creativity to my shoots, but I always try to keep my mind and eyes wide open! I always try and push myself to step outside my comfort zone, but that can be difficult at times. But, as Picasso said, “Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working.”</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018076195/green-cubed-22-by-Sarah-Saratonina\" alt=\"green cubed 22 by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018076195/m%3D900/v2?sig=e8678ab31c652c6d5a6f15d0caf6b77cd7314005c366076f3f6fb066b1449adf\" alt=\"green cubed 22 by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: You often work with a macro lens for your photography, what advantage do you feel the macro lens brings to your work?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The macro lens is great because it allows me to get in much closer to an object or subject. Personally, I prefer to use single lenses because they are sharper and more luminous than most of the zoom lenses. Working with a macro lens also allows me to work even in a very small, tight room. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018298255/Yellow-cubed-31-by-Sarah-Saratonina\" alt=\"Yellow cubed 31 by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018298255/m%3D900/v2?sig=2ba85f3e4291f790c737ea8a6f365f7d6e198bf6b381a3f88c006876f1e5a136\" alt=\"Yellow cubed 31 by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are there other genres of photography outside of still life that you’re interested in shooting?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I am a big fan of creative portraits. Portraits can be fun, and give you the opportunity to use objects or props to reveal some aspects of the subject’s personality. For example, in this portrait of my daughter (below), I use berries falling down like rain to reference her love of strawberries. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/139895595/Strawberry-rain-by-Sarah-Saratonina\" alt=\"Strawberry rain by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/139895595/m%3D900/v2?sig=86e3afaef89c5b1a407e3d6201704f2f1c14765f660507be656bcde9ad181735\" alt=\"Strawberry rain by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018461010/Green-cubed-23-by-Sarah-Saratonina\" alt=\"Green cubed 23 by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018461010/m%3D900/v2?sig=86b5e2116abcf21e0f62798f83d2c15db2914d6188d15c2f8f50fa55e633f99b\" alt=\"Green cubed 23 by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are some thoughts or feelings that you would like to think your work inspires in others?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I frequently receive messages from other photographers who have created photos inspired by my work, and I really appreciate it.

The interaction and sense of community amongst photographers on 500px is very special to me. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1021575044/Yellow-orchids-by-Sarah-Saratonina\" alt=\"Yellow orchids by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1021575044/m%3D900/v2?sig=0f14a0aac1eef83960685f7651f22e1c4a068067b2c3595ec57ec5e324b184f7\" alt=\"Yellow orchids by Sarah Saratonina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: If you were given the opportunity to collaborate on a photo series with any artist, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I would have loved to work with the Belgian painter Rene Magritte, I think his paintings are amazing! I look at his works and feel that he was so creative. I also like that he also used food so much in his art. I wish I could have had the opportunity to work with him, and try my hand at some surrealist-style art with him.</p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?

      "content": "\n<p>In the late 1960s, <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/a-simple-secret-to-better-street-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">street photography</a> was a small club; in New York City, Joel Meyerowitz and Garry Winogrand went out together, pounding the pavement on Fifth Avenue every day, swapping ideas and tips, and occasionally running into the likes of Diane Arbus or Lee Friedlander. </p>\n<p>Fifty years later, with the strides made by camera phones, public interest in the genre has exploded. New York City, the old stomping ground of Arbus and Winogrand, is home to hundreds if not thousands of street photographers. </p>\n<p>Today, a new generation of photographers from London to Mumbai has built global communities, mostly online but also through in-person meetups and photo walks. With the introduction of new technologies and the shift from black and white to color, street photography has changed, but it’s also proven itself to be timeless. </p>\n<p>Although street photography has evolved throughout the decades, the basic tenets remain the same: street photography centers around spontaneous, chance occurrences in public spaces. It’s the documentation of ordinary people and the stories we tell. It’s the hunt for what Henri Cartier-Bresson dubbed “the decisive moment”—a split-second event when, amid the motion and chaos of everyday life, the photographer seizes upon his or her composition. </p>\n<p>These moments are usually candid, though they don’t necessarily have to be, as the genre continues to expand. Of course, people are a regular fixture in street photography, but there’s no rule that says you must have a human presence every shot. Below, we’ve covered fifteen basic tips to help you get started on your street photo journey. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/246577187/Alone-Tonight-by-Andrew-Curry\" alt=\"Alone Tonight by Andrew Curry on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/246577187/m%3D900/v2?sig=d52b5fffcf77edd3e37a2fbd5aa58f330a76305dc9502172d0b092237615eff7\" alt=\"Alone Tonight by Andrew Curry on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wake up early; stay out late</h2>\n<p>Louis Mendes, an iconic New York photographer known for his street portraits, still starts his days around 6:00 am. Head out when the city is just waking up, capture the lunchtime rush, and then document the evening hum as everyone heads home. </p>\n<p>Staying out all day—or taking photos on your regular commute and during breaks at your day job—will give you a number of different lighting conditions and scenarios to explore. A street photographer’s day starts early and continues well into the evening, so dress comfortably, wear your best walking shoes, and hit the streets. Spending more time on the street will also lead to more intimate images, as you’ll know your area better than almost anyone else. </p>\n<p>Don’t forget to bring water and plenty of snacks—and take regular breaks to conserve your energy. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/125626055/Across-The-Universe-by-Hideaki-Hamada\" alt=\"Across The Universe by Hideaki Hamada on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/125626055/m%3D900/v2?sig=3b838b07b75b366ae3e6f7f19b48b381ebce382e62d6c747c3fbfd7470d41f7a\" alt=\"Across The Universe by Hideaki Hamada on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Travel light</h2>\n<p>There’s a reason the 35mm Leica was the gold-standard for street photography for so long, and it’s the same reason so many photographers today use an iPhone. The best camera for street photography isn’t necessarily the most high-tech but the most portable; look for something inconspicuous, discreet, and easy to carry. </p>\n<p>While a zoom might be tempting, you can’t start off with anything better than a simple prime lens. They’re lighter, and they’ll save you time. You don’t want anything slowing you down—especially your gear. A 35mm is a popular choice because it’s close to what we see with our eyes. You can always switch up your lenses from there. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1014325827/watermelons-by-Sabina-Akter\" alt=\"watermelons! by Sabina Akter on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1014325827/m%3D900/v2?sig=474d01febc21bcda16f3652d9de984fe45f40e08b849a0842ed2bbd6f4d0b5d4\" alt=\"watermelons! by Sabina Akter on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Immerse yourself</h2>\n<p>Often, street photographers start by shooting people from a distance, and then, as they grow more confident, they inch closer and closer. Unlike genres like landscapes or formal portraits, street photography requires “getting into the mix” of things; there’s a rawness and immediacy about it—just consider Garry Winogrand’s signature use of a 28mm, wide-angle lens. </p>\n<p>Respect people’s space, and always maintain a safe social distance, but don’t be afraid to enter the fray and become part of the larger scene you’re photographing. You’re a participant too, not just an outside observer. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/245816593/Untitled-by-Karolina-Trapp\" alt=\"Untitled by Karolina Trapp on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/245816593/m%3D900/v2?sig=654134478672e97508042448d4577b19391444dfe0683ff43a0b5da00339984b\" alt=\"Untitled by Karolina Trapp on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Take tons of photos</h2>\n<p>Unless you’re shooting on film, there’s no need to be shy about pressing that shutter button, especially in the beginning. Let go of the perfectionism you might have in the studio and learn to improvise; in the street, you simply don’t have time to plan everything. Remember that Cartier-Bresson, the father of the “decisive moment,” believed in trusting his instincts. If you take a “bad” photo, that’s fine—just keep shooting. </p>\n<p>Winogrand created an estimated one million-plus images throughout his career; most of them didn’t meet his standards. If you get one good picture in a day of constant shooting, consider it a success. Try not to delete your old photos, either; in the golden age of street photography, photographers kept their contact sheets and would return to them often to reevaluate and generate new ideas. </p>\n<p>Another tip: Don’t review all your photos while you’re out shooting, as they can distract you from the moment at hand. You can always look at them when you get home. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/234628907/Happy-Monks-by-Md-Johirul-Islam\" alt=\"Happy Monks by Md Johirul Islam on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/234628907/m%3D900/v2?sig=14595cb368d55a5a7fc1012fa08998325793089be75765a05aec029e1ecf2f9d\" alt=\"Happy Monks by Md Johirul Islam on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Try zone focusing</h2>\n<p>Zone focusing is a common practice among street photographers because it’s quick and it works, assuming you’re using a wider lens (e.g., 21mm-35mm). Manually pre-focus your camera, set a fixed aperture for a wide depth of field (at least f/8), and you’ll end up with a “zone” in which subjects will be in acceptable focus. </p>\n<p>Your only job from there is to wait for your subject(s) to enter into that range. As you practice, you’ll get better at visualizing and “guessing” distances, and you’ll also give yourself more time and freedom to react to what’s happening around you. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/241085691/Joshua-K-Jackson-by-Joshua--Craig\" alt=\"Joshua K. Jackson by Joshua &amp; Craig on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/241085691/m%3D900/v2?sig=84c2bc05d5c00a2b01a01ef6844d9b56bff5e0564d799f32b885b41baba91cf7\" alt=\"Joshua K. Jackson by Joshua &amp; Craig on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Slow down</h2>\n<p>In 1953, the photographer Herbert List badly strained his ankle, leaving him homebound in the apartment of a friend. During this time, he captured the view of the street from his window using a Leica and a telephoto lens—an unusual but not unheard of choice for street photography, especially if you don’t have to carry it around all day. When we think of street photographers, we think of people constantly on the move, but sometimes slowing down and staying in one place can be just as powerful. Take your time, and see what you can observe when you pause for a moment. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/132632247/year-old-by-Daniel-Featherstone\" alt=\"year old by Daniel Featherstone on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/132632247/m%3D900/v2?sig=7d4f4dbdee841cb19e8968e1a45a8f0fc6751942e92c842a2af56667a75fe5ac\" alt=\"year old by Daniel Featherstone on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Give yourself an assignment</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, devoting yourself to a single subject, series, or location can help refine your voice as an artist—and result in images no one else has made. For instance, Walker Evans photographed the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/259978#:~:text=Walker%20Evans%20American,conduct%20of%20his%20fellow%20passengers.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York Subway</a>.

Whether it’s finding a unique spot in your neighborhood and visiting it every day or photographing only animals for a month, consider exploring one niche subject in-depth. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1015471628/Coincidence-by-Julia-Wimmerlin\" alt=\"Coincidence by Julia Wimmerlin on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1015471628/m%3D900/v2?sig=5ac760c9f1e73b3b60862b1a09d065fb606c66f01f146e32421e36d7dd1cf021\" alt=\"Coincidence by Julia Wimmerlin on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Create a time capsule</h2>\n<p>Part of what’s so special about 1960s-era street photography is that cities just don’t look like that anymore; the subways are cleaner, the suits are cut differently, and the hairstyles have evolved. Like photojournalists, street photographers are historians; they might not capture the breaking news of the day, but they do capture the atmosphere and texture of daily life. </p>\n<p>Because cities change so quickly, it’s important to capture what makes your hometown unique, whether it’s the mom-and-pop corner stores, the iconic signage, or the local chess players. These elements won’t be there forever, so document them while you can. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1003213212/Solo-Traveler-by-STEEVENSON-J-L\" alt=\"Solo Traveler by STEEVENSON J.

Seek out these singular, expressive moments; you’ll find they’re everywhere, if you’re willing to look for them. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/284664787/Ready-Set-Go-by-Peter-Stewart\" alt=\"Ready, Set, Go! by Peter Stewart on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/284664787/m%3D900/v2?sig=77789e46e4faaff5209ecad4cc97e5744741a3c4f0cd0921443d3752d4aa5a03\" alt=\"Ready, Set, Go! by Peter Stewart on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Show respect</h2>\n<p>In recent years, the conversation around the ethics of street photography has grown more complex, with special consideration being paid to vulnerable subjects. In the United States and Canada, you can legally photograph people in public, but that doesn’t always mean you should. </p>\n<p>Being a photographer comes with power, and it also carries a responsibility not to exploit or violate anyone’s privacy or put them at risk. Sometimes, when you’re unsure, you’ll get better photos when you ask for consent and collaboration. Treat your subjects with dignity, and know when to put the camera down. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/30553929/biber-by-Leyla-Emektar\" alt=\"biber by Leyla Emektar on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/30553929/m%3D900/v2?sig=6825dc71364aa5ebda6d67aa3752fd07c0f62d70e7ac098562412f789d6b1b69\" alt=\"biber by Leyla Emektar on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Introduce yourself</h2>\n<p>Some street photographers ask permission before taking a photo; many do not. In many cases, you might worry that asking permission will “ruin” the moment or take away from the scene, but it can also make your images more intimate and compelling. Diane Arbus often asked permission; she sometimes spent days photographing the same people. Introducing yourself is also a good way to get over any anxiety you might have about approaching people; the worst that happens is that they say “no,” and you move on. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/286712475/????-by-?-?\" alt=\"???? by ? ? on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/286712475/m%3D900/v2?sig=620d078475e15d5efa03e1e15a99c86c738fe93cff4f13db10cef6a407dd58b2\" alt=\"???? by ? ? on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Learn the rules, and then break them</h2>\n<p>Street photography, like all genres, comes with a set of rules: your photos should be sharp, your subject should be in focus, there should be as little grain as possible, etc. All of these rules are useful, and technical skills will form the backbone of your practice, as will the ability to change your settings on the fly. </p>\n<p>Learning the ins and outs of how your camera works takes time and perseverance, whether you’re shooting fully manual or in a semi-automatic mode. Only when you master those technical elements, can you experiment with “breaking the rules.”   </p>\n<p>With his seminal book <em>The Americans</em>, Robert Frank tossed out the conventions of framing, composition, and focus; he used grain, and some of his pictures came out under or overexposed. Street photographers have always pushed the boundaries, whether that meant using unconventional techniques or shooting in color when black and white was considered the artistic standard. </p>\n<p>This is one of those genres where you can take some creative license and challenge the status quo, so have fun with it. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1020409757/Break-by-charles--lafrance\" alt=\"Break by charles  lafrance on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1020409757/m%3D900/v2?sig=677de192f55f59299c2d64c2e6ffc0eaf07da2112752f66120745f12a932c723\" alt=\"Break by charles  lafrance on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Find a community</h2>\n<p>We started this guide with a story about a small, close-knit group of photographers in New York City in the 1960s. Looking back on this time, Joel Meyerowitz would later <a href=\"https://pdnonline.com/features/photographer-interviews/end-frame-joel-meyerowitz-on-john-szarkowskis-eye/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remark</a> on the sense of kinship and camaraderie that bound them together. They didn’t compete; they shared ideas, swapped stories, and exchanged notes. </p>\n<p>Street photography can feel like a solitary pursuit, but it’s also one that’s rich with networks, communities, and collectives, among them <a href=\"https://www.womenstreetphotographers.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Women Street Photographers</a> and <a href=\"https://streetphotographyinternational.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">International Street Photographers</a>, which host workshops and exhibitions. Wherever you are in your street photography journey, there are people out there waiting to share their expertise and experiences; don’t be afraid to reach out to those you admire on 500px or elsewhere. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/158392271/three-boys-1987-by-CHRIS-DORLEYBROWN\" alt=\"three boys 1987 by CHRIS DORLEY-BROWN on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/158392271/m%3D900/v2?sig=71c9d6ee03aa2f6f6110782abda1c701c06d7b768566d111700ec174b6c5366c\" alt=\"three boys 1987 by CHRIS DORLEY-BROWN on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Shoot for yourself first</h2>\n<p>Some of the most iconic street photographers, including Vivian Cherry and Len Speier, didn’t find worldwide recognition until they were in their twilight years. Vivian Maier was famously “discovered” after her death. Street photography is a long-term game; it’s a genre that many have devoted their lives to, not for stardom or money but for the sheer passion of it. Take photos of subjects that interest you, and make photos that resonate with you before anyone else. The rest can come later. </p>\n<p> <strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/street-photography-tips-best-photos/\">Complete guide to street photography: For beginners</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Smoke bomb photography has been a big trend in 2019, and it’s not going away any time soon. Photographers are using smoke to create atmosphere or add a quick pop of color in portrait, landscape, and abstract photography. When used safely, smoke bombs are a fast, easy, and impressive way to elevate your photos. </p>\n<p>To add this technique to your repertoire, here’s a quick guide to finding the right smoke bomb, planning the perfect shot, and snapping it safely and efficiently. </p>\n<h2>Finding the right smoke bombs</h2>\n<p>First, be aware that there are many different types of smoke bombs. Some come in a can, others in stick or grenade form. Each type and brand will work differently, so look at the features of each before you buy:</p>\n<p><strong>Burn time</strong><br>\nSome smoke bombs will last longer than others. If you are just getting started, find something that will give you close to a minute of active output for each smoke bomb so that you have time to make adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong>Density</strong><br>\nThe density of the smoke will affect its opacity in your image. Decide ahead of time if you want thin coverage for a mist-like effect or fuller, more opaque coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Activation</strong><br>\nDo you need a lighter, or do you just pull a wire? A wire pull is more straightforward to use, but it can add to the price. Just make sure you follow the instructions, no matter which type you choose!</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/192714899/m%3D900/v2?sig=5ebbf2b0c4e4d6d248159e013632422dbb15cf87e21c7f1ebd78dc9cbc2aff46\" alt=\"Paul Hewitt watches. by Nick Verbelchuk on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/192714899/Paul-Hewitt-watches-by-Nick-Verbelchuk\" alt=\"Paul Hewitt watches. by Nick Verbelchuk on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A quick roundup of smoke bomb brands</h2>\n<p><strong>Best value</strong><br><a href=\"https://sparklerockpop.com/collections/smoke-fountains\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Smoke Fountains</a> are a cost-efficient option that come in stick form and give you approximately 45 seconds of burn time per stick. They’re not recommended for hand-holding (like most smoke bombs), but have a lot of colors to choose from, including some color-changing options.</p>\n<p><strong>Easiest to use</strong><br><a href=\"https://peacocksmoke.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peacock Smoke</a> is a great entry-level option. It’s a step above Smoke Fountains in price, but still affordable enough to experiment with. You don’t need a lighter to activate them, and you get up to 90 seconds of effect from one smoke grenade. </p>\n<p><strong>Highest quality</strong><br><a href=\"https://store.enolagaye.com/us/?utm_source=store_uk&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=dropdown_country_selector_us\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Enola Gaye</a> is the choice of many commercial photographers and videographers (just <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29061212/lincoln-aviator-matthew-mcconaughey-commercial/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ask Lincoln and Matthew McConaughey</a>). They have an impressive lineup packed with features—and for their high output models, a price tag to match. Buy in bulk to cut down on the price per unit if you feel confident this will be the brand for you.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/310278665/m%3D900/v2?sig=8a3e2e2954284f3fb3e851e606345622286dd2000dfa806514f201cc31e9c42a\" alt=\"Enthralled by Ian Danda on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/310278665/Enthralled-by-Ian-Danda\" alt=\"Enthralled by Ian Danda on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Budgeting for a smoke bomb photoshoot</h2>\n<p>If you have everything you’ll need for your smoke bomb photography except for the actual smoke bombs, they are easy to budget for. To get started, use these guidelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan some test shoots</strong><br>\nUse your test to see how long the smoke bombs you like last for, and how many you’ll need to use at a time to get the desired coverage. This will help you make a more educated guess when you buy smoke bombs for a specific shoot later on.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider buying in bulk</strong><br>\nThis can help with shipping and handling costs, and many manufacturers will give you a discount per unit if you buy a certain amount in one order.</p>\n<p><strong>Wait for a big sale</strong><br>\nSmoke bombs go on sale, just like any other product.

A smoke bomb will introduce a high volume of new color into your setting, <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/color-theory-photographers-introduction-color-wheel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which you can use to your advantage</a>. Want your smoke to feel out of place and in-your-face? Shoot near its complementary color. Trying for a calmer, more cohesive effect? Seek out analogous color schemes. </p>\n<p><strong>Make sure you plan for weather conditions.</strong> Wind will dissipate the smoke more rapidly, and you won’t be able to control the effect. If you want your smoke to blow around a bit, bring your own wind in the form of a fan. Even a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-EasyAcc-Personal-Portable-Rechargeable/dp/B01FJSJ2QK/ref=asc_df_B01FJSJ2QK/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198093101467&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=10772452285815732855&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9013478&amp;hvtargid=pla-350408076424&amp;psc=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hand-held, battery-operated version</a> will do, and it shouldn’t cost more than $10-$15. </p>\n<p>Once you get started, you’ll need to make the most out of the short amount of active smoke time. <strong>Get your metering and composition out of the way as much as possible before you activate the effect.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Don’t forget the lighting!</strong> Your smoke will be largely opaque, which means you can really make it pop with a speedlight or a set of strobes. The smoke that is not entirely opaque may give you some interesting light streaks to play around with. </p>\n<p>If you choose to hold your smoke bomb during the shoot, <strong>move it around slowly to get distinctive trails rather than shaking it in one spot.</strong> If you have your model do this, ask him or her to walk across the scene with the smoke bomb before settling into place to get better coverage. You can operate it yourself if you are shooting with a tripod or have a friend or assistant do the fan work.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/189021597/m%3D900/v2?sig=2b0fb8b68a25c55e17ddae9b653f1d0d68452deeb950ed5025b3415293216b52\" alt=\"Breatharians by QIURII on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/189021597/Breatharians-by-QIURII-\" alt=\"Breatharians by QIURII on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Some smoke bomb photography inspiration</h2>\n<p>500px is one of the best places to look for smoke bomb photography.

There are some risks associated with this type of photography, so take safety measures during your shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevent fires and explosions with safe use</strong><br>\nStore your smoke bombs away from humidity. Moisture can cause malfunctions inside the smoke bomb, which may result in an unexpected explosion. Conversely, don’t plan to use smoke bombs if it’s especially dry out, or if there is a burn ban in your area. </p>\n<p>When you’re done with a smoke bomb, dispose of it responsibly. Bring a metal bucket to hold the used smoke bombs until your entire shoot is over. Make sure to douse each one with water as you finish. </p>\n<p><strong>Avoid burns</strong><br>\nWhatever form you choose to buy, grip your smoke bomb away from the business end. Always point it away from faces and other body parts when igniting. If nothing happens a second or two after lighting it, back away and wait. This could be a sign that moisture has gotten into your smoke bomb, and it may be about to explode. </p>\n<p>Just in case, always have a first aid kit with you and make sure you have a way to call for help in the event of an emergency. </p>\n<p><strong>Keep from staining clothing and other fabrics</strong><br>\nTo reduce the risk of staining clothes (and the rest of you), never point a smoke bomb directly at a person. However, even if you take every precaution, there’s a chance that colorful powder will end up on your model’s clothing. Any powder that does remain will be more obvious on a lighter color, so plan a wardrobe that’s on the darker side or use clothing that isn’t a concern to stain.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay away from the fumes</strong><br>\nThe smoke can be irritating if inhaled. Have your model hold his or her breath when stepping directly into the smoke, or compose your photograph so that the model can aim his or her nose and mouth away from the natural flow of the smoke. As the photographer, you might also consider positioning yourself away from the natural flow of the smoke. It’s hard to be creative when you’re coughing. </p>\n<p><strong>Don’t cause a panic</strong><br>\nSmoke bombs can alarm people who aren’t expecting them, and for good reason. Only use smoke bombs for your photography where it is legal to do so, and always get permission. If there’s a chance someone could happen upon your shoot unexpectedly, warn them beforehand (if you know who it could be), or put up a handmade sign (if you don’t). </p>\n<p>Likewise, don’t surprise your model with this technique. Inform him or her beforehand of the risks and the precautions you plan to take.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/208644505/m%3D900/v2?sig=0e1502cf77a9d468d07f3925180c43c0540445b2d3e7e70171c8ea68773c2a5a\" alt=\"Smoking Birdcage by PJ Accetturo on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/208644505/Smoking-Birdcage-by-PJ-Accetturo\" alt=\"Smoking Birdcage by PJ Accetturo on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Smoke bomb photoshoot equipment list</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed a lot of things you’ll need for your smoke bomb shoot, so here’s a quick checklist you can refer back to as you plan: </p>\n<p>–<strong>One or more smoke bombs*</strong><br>\n–<strong>A lighter</strong>, if you are using a type of smoke bomb that does not self-ignite*<br>\n–<strong>Lighting</strong> to make your smoke color pops<br>\n–<strong>A fan</strong> to blow the smoke into position<br>\n–<strong>A tripod</strong> (to keep your camera steady while you move around) or an assistant or friend (to help direct the smoke if you are hand-holding your camera)<br>\n–<strong>A metal bucket*</strong><br>\n–<strong>Water*</strong></p>\n<p><em>* These items are absolutely necessary.</em></p>\n<p>Now that you have the knowledge, it’s time to get the tools and plan your shoot. Remember to test different brands as you go to find the smoke bomb that’s right for you. Use the right safety measures, keep an eye on your color theory, and enjoy your brand new photography technique. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p><b>You Might Also Like These Articles:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/capturing-break-dancers-and-smoke-bombs-underground/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Shooting Break Dancers &amp; Smoke Bomb Underground</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/kickass-parkour-action-shots-with-smoke-bombs-fire/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Kickass Parkour Action Shots with Smoke Bombs &amp; Fire</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/interview-action-photography-corey-rich/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Interview: The Action Photography of Corey Rich</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/4-elements-action-photography-water-sports/\"><u>The 4 Elements in Action Photography Part 1 of 4: Water Sports</u></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/smoke-bomb-photography-guide/\">Smoke Bomb Photography | The Essential Guide for Beginners</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

No matter where you are, follow the laws in place to protect the animals and their habitats. Stay on the designated trails, and don’t feed the animals; as the wildlife manager and photographer <a href=\"https://500px.com/p/anskar?view=photos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anskar Lenzen</a> has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9CXVbqo-Wl/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">witnessed</a>, feeding wild animals alters their behavior and puts them at risk. </p>\n<p>Keep your distance (a telephoto lens or teleconverter is your best bet here), and learn to read animal body language—this will vary from species to species—and stop immediately at any sign of alarm or discomfort. Avoid calling or using tape lures to get an animal’s attention, and take care to avoid nests or dens, as these are particularly vulnerable spots. If the animal is threatened or endangered, be especially cautious about publishing or revealing their locations, as it could put them at risk.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not all places that house wild animals are humane and ethical, so do your due diligence to make sure you’re supporting conservation, not exploitation. Before any session or project, research the place you plan to visit. Look for national parks, not-for-profit sanctuaries, or conservancies, and check to make sure they are backed by experts and devoted to the wellbeing of the animals. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/182687249/Conservation-by-Donal-Boyd\" alt=\"Conservation. by Donal Boyd on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/182687249/m%3D900/v2?sig=54a2b056e20679e79ac555dbc8f3df33c96d8d28ae2b143b42031e723cb20a56\" alt=\"Conservation. by Donal Boyd on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Consult local experts</h2>\n<p>Speaking of the experts, local wildlife organizations, activists, rehabilitation centers, and conservancies know the animals better than anyone, and they’ll be able to give you insight on their behaviors, including their favorite spots, migration patterns, feeding times, or the time of day in which they’re most active. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1012147444/Observed-by-Anskar-Lenzen\" alt=\"Observed by Anskar Lenzen on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1012147444/m%3D900/v2?sig=c5db7043a58dbc69b722f3a15653284b7dc2f95f91f0e23bf6d212bfbf57a004\" alt=\"Observed by Anskar Lenzen on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some areas, you can hire an experienced local guide to show you the ropes. You can also reach out to experienced photographers who’ve visited the area extensively for recommendations. Attend lectures by conservationists, or connect with biologists who specialize in your chosen species. Your journey starts well before you even enter the field, so spend as much time as you can learning about the animals you plan to photograph, their habits, and the threats they face. </p>\n<p>The more you know, the stronger your images will be. You might discover an untold story, an overlooked species, or an unexplored angle in the process. Remember to give back to the people who helped you along the way, whether it’s by donating your photos to the cause of conservation or by promoting the work they do. Give your audience a concrete way to help by linking to a charity or organization you trust. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/182686841/Why-did-the-Giraffe-cross-the-road-by-Donal-Boyd\" alt=\"Why did the Giraffe cross the road? by Donal Boyd on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/182686841/m%3D900/v2?sig=fe186f7ece0347cb2a6a2e79be7ab4c69faf62e4a53c584d6afc572e99348150\" alt=\"Why did the Giraffe cross the road? by Donal Boyd on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>You could end up forming a long-term partnership with these conservation groups; the renowned photographer and conservationist <a href=\"https://500px.com/p/donalboyd?view=photos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Donal Boyd</a>, for example, has devoted the last few years to his role as photographer-in-residence at Erindi Private Game Reserve, covering the stories of the animals and those who work to protect them. </p>\n<h2>Practice, and then practice some more</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re shooting in manual mode or aperture priority, you’ll need to adjust those settings on the fly. It’s true that studying and observing animal behavior will give you a good indication of what an animal might do at any given moment, but wildlife is unpredictable, and individual animals have different personalities, so you’ll often have a fraction of a second to get your shot. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/5746178/Swan-Lake-by-Martin-Bailey\" alt=\"Swan Lake by Martin Bailey on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/5746178/m%3D900/v2?sig=fc93140e5376b03fbf0c990d0c052a16e9eb6a5a0f9249ceeb6d1ad0c93ef8ec\" alt=\"Swan Lake by Martin Bailey on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The nature and wildlife photographer <a href=\"https://500px.com/p/martinbailey?view=photos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Bailey</a> has raised his camera and taken pictures in the field without even thinking about it consciously.

Because you’re going to be spending so much time in the field, remember to take care of yourself; bundle up in layers for cold climates (invest in photographer-specific gloves and top-of-the-line outerwear), and bring sunscreen and a hat on bright days. Have enough food and water to last at least a few days. </p>\n<p>Take precautions with your gear as well; make sure your camera is weather-sealed, invest in a great backpack and solid tripod, and avoid changing lenses in dusty regions (if possible, bring two bodies for more versatility). Telephoto lenses are expensive, so treat them with care. If you can, have backup accessories and gear on hand. In cold weather, your batteries will run out quickly. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/87404643/Playful-Leopard-Cub-by-Will-BurrardLucas\" alt=\"Playful Leopard Cub by Will Burrard-Lucas on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/87404643/m%3D900/v2?sig=46b860c0f4b06870f290f20692eff79741f83cc2ca40ac10b8af0d2a9af33718\" alt=\"Playful Leopard Cub by Will Burrard-Lucas on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another note on gear: you might encounter some weight restrictions while traveling, so pack lightly if possible, while still covering your bases—a telephoto for details and a 24-70mm lens for some environmental shots should do the trick. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/184455219/Snowed-In-by-Benjamin-Hardman\" alt=\"Snowed In. by Benjamin Hardman on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/184455219/m%3D900/v2?sig=d6952f4b6f57abeaa7be6e03893ae0c4f0b168ea73c5206ba52390fb63373728\" alt=\"Snowed In. by Benjamin Hardman on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Provide a sense of place</h2>\n<p>Speaking of environmental shots, remember to get a variety of angles and perspectives that show the animal’s habitat.

Silhouette portraits came into vogue in the 18th century, when they took on the popular form of cut card or paper. In photography, silhouettes take on a simpler meaning: a dark subject against a bright background. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/194705547/Goat-Lake-by-Sparth-Nicolas-Bouvier\" alt=\"Goat Lake by Sparth (Nicolas Bouvier) on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/194705547/m%3D900/v2?sig=9f2436cadb99f6114f1536e202acad868dbb0e238b6171a634108bed898b0e27\" alt=\"Goat Lake by Sparth (Nicolas Bouvier) on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The formula for creating a silhouette, then, is relatively straightforward: you need a strong light source, and you’ll need to position your subject between the camera (and yourself) and the light. You can use studio lights or opt for sunlight outdoors or through a window, a method known as <em>contre-jour</em>, or “against daylight.” If you can’t move the subject or light source, as in the case of landscapes, you’ll have to move your position in relation to them. </p>\n<p>Regardless of the light source, the important thing is that the person, animal, or object in the photo is illuminated from behind, with you standing (or crouching) on their other side. Additional light sources or reflectors coming from the front or side (e.g., an on-camera flash) will ruin the effect, so stick with strong backlighting, and you’re good to go. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/171712483/Surfer-on-the-horizon-by-Ashley-McKinney\" alt=\"Surfer on the horizon by Ashley McKinney on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/171712483/m%3D900/v2?sig=20a23ffd87316ee5f1cfcb7021a0ea303488413d43d6c23c49f2a6a110f718ef\" alt=\"Surfer on the horizon by Ashley McKinney on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Try the golden hour</h2>\n<p>Natural light can create beautiful, romantic silhouettes, but it’s also harder to control and modify, so you need to get the timing right. At the golden hour, the sun is lower on the horizon, so it’s perfect for backlighting. If the sun is too high and bright, it is more likely to illuminate the details on and in front of your subject—and that’s something you don’t want. </p>\n<p>Sunset silhouettes are especially popular, but if you’re shooting in a popular destination, you might try sunrise to avoid crowds. If the sunlight feels too bright and you’re not getting enough detail on that golden hour sky, consider using a polarizing filter for more saturation and contrast. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/190949077/Under-the-Pier-by-Ashley-McKinney\" alt=\"Under the Pier by Ashley McKinney on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/190949077/m%3D900/v2?sig=931f114adcdae90390bd47431b1386e3e2f2f4d7822a3941e7b057d1e7513605\" alt=\"Under the Pier by Ashley McKinney on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based photographer <a href=\"https://500px.com/ashleymckinney\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ashley McKinney</a> uses the golden hour to create dreamy, sunkissed beach silhouettes that speak to the beauty and freedom of summer. </p>\n<h2>Scout your location</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re shooting indoors or outdoors, study the location and see how the light looks during different seasons and at different times of day. In general, clean, uncluttered backgrounds work best for silhouettes, so look for open space. If it’s a public area, plan to go when there’s little foot traffic.

If you’re photographing a person, make sure to separate the limbs and create clean angles using the elbows or knees. </p>\n<p>Some popular poses include running, jumping, or yoga positions, all of which use negative space to sculpt the body. For portraits, profiles tend to be more distinct than head-on views. Train your eye to see in two dimensions, rather than three, to determine the best subjects and poses. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/171722719/Surfer-at-sunset-on-Venice-Beach-by-Ashley-McKinney\" alt=\"Surfer at sunset on Venice Beach by Ashley McKinney on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/171722719/m%3D900/v2?sig=7195ace3091f73d79795422859b854c4b32bdd0915ab845fc8f7a59ea2f9918b\" alt=\"Surfer at sunset on Venice Beach by Ashley McKinney on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you’re working with a group of people or animals, wait until they are stretched out and far apart enough that you can see each of their outlines individually and make out their movements and positions.

In matrix or evaluative mode, it analyzes the whole scene and determines the correct exposure based on that information; that works when you want a balance between light and dark, but it might not be ideal for silhouettes. </p>\n<p>In that case, we recommend switching to spot metering and “telling” your camera to ignore everything except a specific spot in the bright background (if you’re outdoors, that would be the sky, but not the sun itself, as aiming directly at the sun will damage your lens). That way, instead of exposing for the subject, it will leave it underexposed, creating that solid shape you want. A word of caution: when using spot metering, remember to make sure your focus is still on the subject, not the background.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/160609971/Formation-by-Garrett-Roth\" alt=\"Formation by Garrett Roth on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/160609971/m%3D900/v2?sig=bd3951b4d9ea8f8bee99f2afb0640f89a1be8dd2cdaeba8ba75e8d27798d227b\" alt=\"Formation by Garrett Roth on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you’re still not getting dark enough silhouettes, consider underexposing a tad or using exposure bracketing, so you have a few options. To make your silhouette stand out even more, you can always use an extra flash behind your subject for some rim lighting. </p>\n<h2>Watch your aperture</h2>\n<p>A wide depth of field is essential for creating those crisp outlines and details, so keep everything sharp by using a higher f-number (f/8 or smaller). Another benefit of smaller apertures is that it’ll minimize any chromatic aberrations. You might choose to block the sun or light source with your subject, especially if you’re wary of blown-out highlights, but if you want that “sunburst” effect poking out from behind it instead, you’ll need a smaller aperture.</p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind: when you close down your aperture, you let in less light, so you might be tempted to bump up your ISO to brighten the image. In some cases, this is fine, but depending on your camera, it might result in noise, particularly in the shadows. In a silhouette, the darks are the most important areas, so it’s best to avoid noise by using as low an ISO as possible. </p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our articles on <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/aperture-in-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aperture</a>, <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/shutter-speed-in-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shutter speed</a>, and <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/what-is-iso-and-how-to-use-it-in-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ISO</a> for a better understanding of the exposure triangle. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/303439241/-by-Garrett-Roth\" alt=\" by Garrett Roth on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/303439241/m%3D900/v2?sig=8d528878f50892e4b694a34023caa5262805f9369e45738e975f8eb8cee8cefb\" alt=\" by Garrett Roth on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Get low</h2>\n<p>Photographing your subject from below is common in silhouette photography for a few reasons; first, it enables you to get those shadows (or reflections) on the ground, which are particularly long during the golden hour. Secondly, if you’re shooting outdoors, a low position will help you avoid clutter in the background; bend down, and you’ll end up with a blank sky as your canvas. You can move around throughout the shoot to see what angle works best. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/203857085/Nightcrawler-by-Kaleb-Jordan\" alt=\"Nightcrawler by Kaleb Jordan on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/203857085/m%3D900/v2?sig=dff3e0b6fe7073c91e62a811c673ba905afee3edc8eb41f3fc883ab08e0e30da\" alt=\"Nightcrawler by Kaleb Jordan on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tell a story</h2>\n<p>Silhouettes are inherently cinematic, having appeared in iconic films ranging from <em>The Third Man</em> to <em>Psycho</em>, where they’re used to evoke mystery and suspense. Elliot Erwitt used silhouettes in <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/shop/collections/contemporary-posters/magnum-collection-poster-the-eiffel-towers-100th-anniversary-paris-france-1989/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Paris in 1989</a> to evoke an entirely different emotion—love and romance—when photographing the Eiffel Tower. </p>\n<p>Silhouettes feel anonymous, so they’re particularly powerful when they reflect universal stories. Whether it’s a thriller or a love story, consider the narrative and the characters at the heart of your photo. In photos without details like color or texture to identify the subject, it’s often this emotional core or plot that creates interest and intrigue.  </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/5039144/View-by-Sparth-Nicolas-Bouvier\" alt=\"View by Sparth (Nicolas Bouvier) on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/5039144/m%3D900/v2?sig=c892b464263fe2718692407b03b3d4d2d030a406ac38ad78d02cd11673c0fbdf\" alt=\"View by Sparth (Nicolas Bouvier) on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tweak it in post</h2>\n<p>While editing your photos, consider boosting the silhouette effect by bumping up that contrast and adjusting your shadows and blacks to get those deep, inky tones. It can help to convert your photo to black and white from time to time to better visualize how the different values affect the scene.  </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/126628485/Down-under-by-Kaleb-Jordan\" alt=\"Down under by Kaleb Jordan on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/126628485/m%3D900/v2?sig=f750adcfa9e2582d5ac04133299c0c7fa741b786fed4ca95d575486d29a1d129\" alt=\"Down under by Kaleb Jordan on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, when shooting silhouettes, you don’t have to stick with the usual light sources like the sun or a window. The Indiana-based photographer <a href=\"https://500px.com/lurkerlife\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kaleb Jordan</a> has created evocative, cinematic photos using available light like streetlamps or the illumination coming into underground tunnels, to mysterious effect. </p>\n<p>Think outside the box, and find a light source that serves as a character in your story or narrative, and remember: not all silhouettes have to be completely dark. You can use partial silhouettes for some dimension, or make them dark for a flat, two-dimensional look. The choice is yours. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/guide-photographing-silhouettes/\">How to photograph silhouettes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Henri Cartier-Bresson did it. Edward Steichen and Richard Avedon did too. Ansel Adams recently <a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/ansel-adams-golden-ratio/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">went viral</a> for using it. Of course, we’re talking about the golden ratio, the divine proportion, or phi—a seemingly magical number that crops up time and again in the work of master photographers. Whether they used it intentionally or not, the ratio has become a defining principle in the art and history of the medium. </p>\n<p>Here’s a brief refresher from math class: two numbers or objects are in the golden ratio if their ratio is equal to the ratio of their sum to the largest number. Numbers in the famous Fibonacci Sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.) come close to the golden ratio, becoming even closer as they progress. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019844925/PALAFITOS-by-Pascal-Krumm\" alt=\"PALAFITOS by Pascal Krumm on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019844925/m%3D900/v2?sig=b5cc6f01aab8801cdb1178bd0979c043794e72105468c7f110b60e59ae64cd0e\" alt=\"PALAFITOS by Pascal Krumm on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The golden ratio can be represented by the number phi, or approximately 1.618. You can find this number throughout the human face and body as well as in nature, from plants to celestial objects. Many say the ratio is inherently pleasing to the human eye, and some say it’s simply the result of our desire to find meaning and patterns in our surroundings, but the fact remains that it’s been used in art for centuries. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/280246705/Stronger-by-milos-nejezchleb\" alt=\"Stronger by milos nejezchleb on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/280246705/m%3D900/v2?sig=88025fa9215dc0921e4a7aedae05210b446f613427417a605f8de1ee2d2c32d5\" alt=\"Stronger by milos nejezchleb on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Architects like Le Corbusier and painters like Salvador Dalí incorporated the number into their masterpieces, and it’s been applied by scholars to countless works of art and design, ranging from Botticelli to Michelangelo, sometimes retrospectively. For photographers, of course, it’s become one of many tricks for creating asymmetrical balance within a single frame. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/74685963/Vegetable-Seller-by-Ali-ALZuhair\" alt=\"Vegetable Seller by Ali AL-Zuhair on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/74685963/m%3D900/v2?sig=e16f7f977fcde8aa4027dd6fa26996a61529b215b14c940e6968cc013353bfab\" alt=\"Vegetable Seller by Ali AL-Zuhair on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sometimes, the golden ratio is shifted slightly to become <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/rule-of-thirds/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the rule of thirds</a>, though many feel that the latter is an oversimplification. With the rule of thirds, you’ll divide your rectangular frame equally like a tic-tac-toe board (1:1:1 vertically and 1:1:1 horizontally); instead, you might choose to divide it according to the golden ratio: 1:0.618:1. It’s up to you, but many believe that the second comes closer to achieving that perfect harmonious balance. </p>\n<p>Luckily, you can easily apply a golden ratio overlay to any photo in Photoshop or a similar editing app. In that case, your subject or point of interest would fall a bit further inside those thirds lines, and you might also place your horizon along one of those lines. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018247498/Moon-for-Sale-2-by-milos-nejezchleb\" alt=\"Moon for Sale #2 by milos nejezchleb on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018247498/m%3D900/v2?sig=52c5d870359c95493793e570d118a97e49530e21fc31d071b342e25214ae5d99\" alt=\"Moon for Sale #2 by milos nejezchleb on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This photo by<a href=\"https://500px.com/p/nejmil?view=photos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Milos Nejezchleb</a>, for instance, applies the principle to direct the eye to the hands of the women as well as the edges of the door frames, light fixtures, and signage (see a close-up with Photoshop grid lines below); you’ll find that many images in his portfolio use the golden ratio to similar effect. </p>\n<p>You might have heard, too, about the golden rectangle, or a rectangle whose sides are in the golden ratio. In geometry, you probably studied the golden spiral—a logarithmic spiral with a growth factor equal to phi—as well. The nautilus shell is famous for following this spiral, and many photographic compositions might also adhere to the curve of the golden or Fibonacci spiral. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/219534955/Women-collecting-red-chilies-by-Azim-Khan-Ronnie\" alt=\"Women collecting red chilies by Azim Khan Ronnie on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/219534955/m%3D900/v2?sig=7aca16228f573df7c21a947680ba663a8a6d892e452e532348dd1c8006b00b87\" alt=\"Women collecting red chilies by Azim Khan Ronnie on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This photo by <a href=\"https://500px.com/p/azimronnie?view=photos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Azim Khan Ronnie</a>, for example, positions various women along the Fibonacci spiral to guide our eye to the main subject—the woman in the foreground—who occupies the tightest coil of the spiral. Every figure is essential, forming a visual map that serves to bring the “hero” into greater focus. </p>\n<p>Of course, these are just two ways of using the golden ratio to compose your images, but possibilities abound. When you’re in the field, practice keeping that spiral or phi grid in the back of your mind. The more you use it, the better you’ll get at composing your shots in the moment, rather than having to finesse your compositions on the computer. </p>\n<p>You won’t be able to follow the golden ratio using an overlay in your viewfinder, as you would the rule of thirds, simply because all the variations would make it too confusing, but this can actually be an asset rather than an obstacle because you’re forced to visualize it on your own. </p>\n<p>Bending down, climbing stairs, and moving to the right or left are all ways to exert control over what’s in your frame and what isn’t; if you’re working with moving subjects, it can also pay to wait until someone enters just the right portion of that rectangle. You can always capture a few shots of the same subject to see what comes closest to aligning with the spiral or grid. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019851178/?????-by-??-\" alt=\"????? by ??  on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019851178/m%3D900/v2?sig=713490727b5ec8cae62858cb8fd2e25fb45aec429784a44dacd352c076cb2b1f\" alt=\"????? by ??  on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>It can also help to consume as many images as possible, training your eye by studying photos that work. Cartier-Bresson himself regularly studied paintings to deepen his understanding of geometry. Throughout this article, you’ll find examples of compositions that follow the phi grid or the Fibonacci spiral. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/206700501/A-woman-in-sari-watching-the-sunrise-in-Udaipur-lake-by-Gil-Kreslavsky\" alt=\"A woman in sari watching the sunrise in Udaipur lake by Gil Kreslavsky on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/206700501/m%3D900/v2?sig=4dc8d05746116222dc81505d71a95cd8a4d47dd1e4c747dd6f84837def9e36ec\" alt=\"A woman in sari watching the sunrise in Udaipur lake by Gil Kreslavsky on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>When used correctly, as we see here, the golden ratio can bring your photos to life. But as with any photography guideline, it isn’t necessarily a rule; it’s just a tool. Some photographers swear by the divine proportion, while others think it’s overhyped. The truth—like the ratio—is more complex: it works in many situations, but it might not work every time. </p>\n<p>The curves of the human face, for instance, naturally lend themselves to this compositional technique, as do works of architecture, but it’s ultimately up to you where to place the eyes, the horizon line, and other essential details. Follow the ratio when you want to convey a sense of harmony and balance, but don’t be afraid to mix it up and try new things as well. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/302528261/Diving-platform-2-by-carla-photographics\" alt=\"Diving platform 2 by carla photographics on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/302528261/m%3D900/v2?sig=4738c12f734ed27c7c607c367d89882f6ed810dbce23f7dac4539dddf248bd54\" alt=\"Diving platform 2 by carla photographics on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The golden ratio has, in one way or another, informed artworks for centuries—and inspired best-selling novels—and we’re still learning more about it.

While we might not yet understand everything about it, this number seems to be baked into our anatomy, so it makes sense that we seek it out in art, consciously or not. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/golden-ratio-photography/\">How to use the golden ratio in your photography: A beginner’s guide</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

Please introduce yourself to our readers.<br>\nIURIE BELEGURSCHI:</b> I’m originally from Moldova. I moved permanently to Iceland in 2006. I work full-time as a professional landscape photographer. I also run <a href=\"http://www.iceland-photo-tours.com/\" target=\"_blank\">photo tours and workshops</a> in Iceland and around the world. In fact, I have an upcoming Winter Workshop starting October, where I will be taking photographers on a hunt for Aurora Borealis and on an ice cave tour. My work has been published in major newspapers, magazines, books, and calendars worldwide. My two passions in life are photography and traveling.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306053681/m%3D900/v2?sig=1e0e23da1f4699388bb2fca0468abb76d30c3f24f9b1b105aab15410f936bdca\" alt=\"Steamy Kerlingarfjoll by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306053681/Steamy-Kerlingarfjoll-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Steamy Kerlingarfjoll by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>How did you discover photography and how long have you been doing this?<br>\nIURIE:</b> I have been shooting for many years, but I got serious about my photography five years ago.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306433489/m%3D900/v2?sig=81d87390f81ed58c65930a786142ef42204b96e3bdef7eedccc2ce36e69aa56d\" alt=\"Icelandic Highlands by Drone by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306433489/Icelandic-Highlands-by-Drone-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Icelandic Highlands by Drone by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>As a landscape and travel photographer, how much time do you spend out in the field?<br>\nIURIE:</b> I do mostly tours and workshops in Iceland, Norway, and Greenland, so I am outdoors 90% of the time, shooting with my guests.

What type of subjects do you enjoy shooting the most?<br>\nIURIE:</b> Icelandic landscapes, of course! I love winterscapes, snow-covered mountains, icy lakes, waterfalls, glaciers, and ice caves. I like night photography the most—shooting the Milky Way, stars, and the Northern Lights. It gives me a sense of fulfillment and peace when I’m outdoors at night, capturing what is relatively hard to fully see with the naked eye. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/309537729/m%3D900/v2?sig=2257080d060e4b667fa83280e740d0acedc06a369776161c6b5436147b9c171e\" alt=\"Blue Ice Cave by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/309537729/Blue-Ice-Cave-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Blue Ice Cave by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306650741/m%3D900/v2?sig=3c54060c2c774e4bf176f03c1201e27cd9720ba14a7e54de964c40a2ea216f9f\" alt=\"Mothership by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306650741/Mothership-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Mothership by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>What about Iceland do you find the most fascinating, and what makes it different from the landscape of other countries?<br>\nIURIE:</b> Iceland is a photographer’s paradise, truly “the land of ice and fire”. We have amazing waterfalls all around the country—volcanoes, glaciers, mountain ranges, rivers, lakes, black sand beaches, rocky coastlines, and more. When you combine this with the Northern Lights in winter and the Midnight Sun in summer, the creative possibilities are endless.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/294586479/m%3D900/v2?sig=1f29d4e31790a657b91f63d2fc6dbc2dbca368f8776dd6a7f6942737eb2e94c0\" alt=\"Far Away in the Clouds by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/294586479/Far-Away-in-the-Clouds-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Far Away in the Clouds by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>In all your years of experience, what has been the most difficult terrain or weather condition to shoot?<br>\nIURIE:</b> Definitely mountains and winter. You have to deal with lots of hiking, elevated to get to vantage points from the top. Bringing your gear and the weight of the clothes you wear to keep yourself warm is challenging. You have to be physically and mentally fit to be able to keep doing it. I have been shooting as well in sandstorms, windstorms, and blizzards—those are always a challenge.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/307987393/m%3D900/v2?sig=eb7565903640d1c12f1c57ef9562a3c2f4522eecdadf3441d20a566fe0ebb94a\" alt=\"Reflection of Kirkjufell by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/307987393/Reflection-of-Kirkjufell-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Reflection of Kirkjufell by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>What’s the photograph that you are the most proud of?<br>\nIURIE:</b> I was guiding a workshop. We had been stuck due to bad weather, but we were planning on shooting at a glacier lagoon. I really wanted everyone to get a great sunset shot, as it was near the end of our trip. So, I took a risk and drove through a major sandstorm to get there. As we arrived, I could see that soon the sky would be on fire. We quickly set up.

Start with a vision of you want to achieve as a landscape photographer.<br>\n2. Quality is better than quantity when it comes to landscape photography.<br>\n3. Keep yourself motivated. You will realize that landscape photography is not easy—the weather, the hiking, getting the best conditions for the shot or mood you want.<br>\n4. Look to others’ work for inspiration, and keep on learning. It never stops.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/244017389/m%3D900/v2?sig=bee6f4118caa2bc4344297f8da14f28bfa1e9061336daa9bc101616531a54325\" alt=\"Above the Highlands by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/244017389/Above-the-Highlands-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Above the Highlands by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b></b></p>\n<h3>CHOOSING A LOCATION FOR LANDSCAPE PHOTOS</h3>\n<p><br>\n5. Be prepared and plan ahead for location. Consider the direction or state of the sun and moon.<br>\n6. I always look for leading lines, a good foreground, angle of view to the subject, direction of the natural light, and the direction of the moon if there is one.<br>\n7. Visit your locations ahead of time, and scout for other vantage points. You may find something that takes a bit more effort and time to reach, and you may not make it if you arrive on the dot. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/244668591/m%3D900/v2?sig=72f0205ac81636d1d259a768e9a5b8e16cedc21a1770f9d6f13144faa249d0e4\" alt=\"Thunderous Fall of the Gods by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/244668591/Thunderous-Fall-of-the-Gods-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Thunderous Fall of the Gods by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>8. When you arrive at your scene, don’t rush your shots. Take 5 minutes to “see” the scene, and then form your shooting plan.<br>\n9. Get to your location early and stay there late.<br>\n10. I see photographers shooting for one hour during sunset from the same spot with same composition. Get up, move around, change your direction, change your focal length, and shoot different photos.<br>\n11. When you are shooting seascapes, always take a look at the tides before you visit. Some places are better shot in high tide, some in low tide.<br>\n12. For seascapes, also take note of the prevailing tide swells in the sea. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306053681/m%3D900/v2?sig=1e0e23da1f4699388bb2fca0468abb76d30c3f24f9b1b105aab15410f936bdca\" alt=\"Steamy Kerlingarfjoll by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306053681/Steamy-Kerlingarfjoll-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Steamy Kerlingarfjoll by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><h3>TIPS ON ON THE BEST TIME TO SHOOT</h3></b><br>\n13. I prefer to take my photos at 12 o’clock noon—okay, I’m kidding! You cannot get the very best results without missing some sleep. I will get to my location an hour before sunrise or sunset. After sunset, you can find me chasing the Northern Lights!</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306905105/m%3D900/v2?sig=d2535a919f44b097ebe395adf0320024c9f7bb93242084ca7e8128af596f4665\" alt=\"Still Water at Vestrahorn by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306905105/Still-Water-at-Vestrahorn-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Still Water at Vestrahorn by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><h3>WHAT GEAR AND EQUIPMENT SHOULD I USE FOR LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY</h3></b><br>\n14. Get a tripod. I see many new photographers with expensive gear, but very flimsy tripods. It is so important to have a very stable tripod and camera mounting system.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/286847825/m%3D900/v2?sig=c32c243aa42dfb378daacc067fe4d35de62e0c87ad46591bd7843d97914dc7db\" alt=\"The Rolling Hills of Tuscany by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/286847825/The-Rolling-Hills-of-Tuscany-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"The Rolling Hills of Tuscany by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>15. Make sure to check the quality of the gear and filters you use. It is foolish to think that everything can be done and corrected in post.<br>\n16. I personally shoot with <a href=\"http://bhpho.to/1ufp3xi\" target=\"_blank\">Canon 5DM III</a>. My second body is <a href=\"http://bhpho.to/1oce9q5\" target=\"_blank\">Canon 6D</a>.<br>\n17. My go-to lens for most of my landscapes is the <a href=\"http://bhpho.to/TeRIp2\" target=\"_blank\">Canon 16-35 f/2.8 II</a>. My passion is in seeing and capturing the wide-angle, so I use the Canon 16-35 f/2.8 II lens most of the time.<br>\n18. At night, I love shooting with the <a href=\"http://bhpho.to/Sr28RD\" target=\"_blank\">Canon 24 f/1.4</a> lens. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/305117235/m%3D900/v2?sig=d7e36b9c04177aeef39361f6273724e287891402b3f85ffa88ab6c4f96765b38\" alt=\"Aerial View of the Icelandic Highlands by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/305117235/Aerial-View-of-the-Icelandic-Highlands-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Aerial View of the Icelandic Highlands by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>19. For the panoramas I have recently started to shoot, I use <a href=\"http://bit.ly/S9yWyb\" target=\"_blank\">Really Right Stuff double-row panorama gear</a> on top of my <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1oX9J8z\" target=\"_blank\">Really Right Stuff tripod</a>, which is an amazing combination.<br>\n20. As I do more panoramas, I am experimenting with longer focal lens lengths to gain maximum resolution of my final image.<br>\n21. I don’t rely on much more gear, but I am never without a <a href=\"http://bhpho.to/1iYpWCY\" target=\"_blank\">Circular Polarizer</a> and my <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1jRQyFv\" target=\"_blank\">Lee Filter System</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306650741/m%3D900/v2?sig=3c54060c2c774e4bf176f03c1201e27cd9720ba14a7e54de964c40a2ea216f9f\" alt=\"landscape photography - Mothership by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306650741/Mothership-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"landscape photography - Mothership by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><h3>POST-PROCESSING TIPS FOR LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY SHOTS</h3></b><br>\n22. The work is only partially done when you press the shutter. I shoot in RAW and process my photos in Lightroom and Photoshop—it is extremely important.<br>\n23. My workflow involves basic moves such as lens correction, chromatic aberration, white balance, and minor tone curve adjustments. From there, it’s very simple. I typically only spend 5-10 minutes finishing an image; mostly, color and exposure adjustments. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/307673235/m%3D900/v2?sig=ca29f7ec4f01f98fdbb907e5d07c72e5408c4f21c11800c0d009a4234dc078a7\" alt=\"Waterfall in the Icelandic Highlands by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/307673235/Waterfall-in-the-Icelandic-Highlands-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Waterfall in the Icelandic Highlands by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><br>\nWe hope you found Iurie’s tips and thoughts on shooting landscapes helpful.<br>\nTo see more of his work, follow Iurie Belegurschi on <a href=\"http://500px.com/IurieBelegurschi\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>500px</strong></a>, or thumb up his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IurieBelegurschiPhotography\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Page</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information on his photo tours and workshops, visit <a href=\"http://www.iceland-photo-tours.com/iceland-winter-aurora-photo-workshop/\" target=\"_blank\">Winter Photo Workshops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guidetoiceland.is/\" target=\"_blank\">Guide To Iceland</a>, or subscribe to his <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/QmJs5\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/295652835/m%3D900/v2?sig=5a9a572ca28a24ce68f5256a9a664c9e15d1132e1d172b152bdef2c5395191f5\" alt=\"Running with the Horses by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/295652835/Running-with-the-Horses-by-Iurie-Belegurschi\" alt=\"Running with the Horses by Iurie Belegurschi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Got a question for Iurie?

More stores ultimately followed suit, inspired in part by the efforts of campaigns like <a href=\"http://lettoysbetoys.org.uk/about/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Let Toys Be Toys</a> in the UK, which combats gender stereotyping in books and toys for kids. </p>\n<p>As brands wise up to the importance of accurately representing their customers and their interests, they’re stepping away from tired ideas and embracing gender-neutral messaging. These steps can mean changing up their signage, or it could mean steering clear of photographs that portray people in a reductive, stereotypical light. </p>\n<p>Here’s just one example of how stereotypes can influence the commercial field—and how they can be challenged. A search for beauty photos on almost any major image platform will bring up mostly photos of cis-gender women, but in fact, skincare and cosmetic brands are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/hello-coverboy-cosmetics-and-skin-care-brands-turn-to-gender-neutral-packaging/2020/03/02/2c30f49e-54d4-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">making an effort</a> to keep gender out of the equation by switching to gender-neutral products and unisex packaging. </p>\n<p>In real life, people of all genders use skincare and cosmetics, and that should be reflected in advertising too. Of course, the same goes for all kinds of commercial photos, from business and fashion to family and lifestyle. </p>\n<p>“Think about capturing diverse ways in which gender can be expressed, such as clothing, grooming, or color,” the 500px Content Team advises. “While traditionally within photos of children, the color blue is often associated with boys and pink with girls, using what would be considered gender-neutral colors can be a simple way of challenging biases.”</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306671101/Alefta-by-Alex-Strelkovv\" alt=\"Alefta by Alex Strelkovv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306671101/m%3D900/v2?sig=21fca94264d11c56e35b0105b840b0a29023cd7b0d08074043d40522efede5e9\" alt=\"Alefta by Alex Strelkovv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Do the research</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://intelligence.wundermanthompson.com/trend-reports/understanding-transgender-inclusivity-advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a study</a> from Wunderman Thompson Intelligence revealed that the majority of customers (71%) are open to seeing advertisements that feature transgender people, as they simply reflect the reality of our society. But most said they rarely (35%) or never (42%) see transgender people in ads, and the average American still has some misperceptions about what it means to be transgender. </p>\n<p>Ads have a significant role in influencing how people think about gender identity, and there aren’t nearly enough authentic representations of trans and non-binary people out there, so it’s important to get it right. Keep in mind that the media, at times, has historically misrepresented marginalized gender identities, so it’s worth consulting a local advocacy group and perusing <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/transgender/mediaresources\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GLAAD’s resources for Media Professionals</a> to learn how to be an ally for the community and portray people accurately in your images. </p>\n<h2>Keyword correctly</h2>\n<p>Speaking of GLAAD, be sure to check out their <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">glossary of terms</a> while keywording and titling your photos. If you aren’t sure, you should always check your model release to ascertain a person’s preferred gender pronoun and terms to avoid misgendering and misrepresenting someone in your photos. </p>\n<p>“Non-binary, gender fluid, trans, and androgynous are just some gender identities someone can have,” the 500px Content Team tells us. These are all keywords you might use, but make sure they are accurate to the person in the photo. </p>\n<p>As part of <a href=\"http://press.gettyimages.com/getty-image-has-taken-action-with-dove-girlgaze-and-women-around-the-world-to-create-project-showus/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Project #ShowUs</a>, a groundbreaking collection of images by women and non-binary individuals, Getty Images took a novel approach to keywording and metadata; instead of applying general terms, they asked every individual to write their own search descriptions and keywords. You can always take a similarly collaborative approach to any photoshoot, regardless of the person’s gender identity. </p>\n<p>Of course, avoid using problematic terms like “sex change,” “pre-operative,” or “post-operative,” as they inaccurately imply that someone needs to have surgery to transition. In your image titles, remember that “transgender” is an adjective; someone can be “a transgender person,” but not “a transgender.”</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/306465929/Andy-y-Madeleine-by-Nicolas-Fuentes\" alt=\"Andy y Madeleine by Nicolas Fuentes on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/306465929/m%3D900/v2?sig=9caacc1881d8304b59c9f0b6e21077dde2b0f22db67947b73182bd20cbd961dc\" alt=\"Andy y Madeleine by Nicolas Fuentes on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Highlight real-life moments</h2>\n<p>For too long, commercial photos centering around topics related to gender identity have been one-dimensional. For instance, it’s often easier to find photos of flags and marches than it is to find images of real people in their everyday lives. </p>\n<p>Gender representation means going beyond the surface and giving voice to the communities themselves; brands want pictures of trans and non-binary people at home with their families or at work on a project. They want photos of people of all genders playing with their kids and reaching their goals. </p>\n<p>More than a third of Gen Zers in the US strongly agree that gender does not define a person as much as it used to, so look for ways to capture every facet of a person’s identity, no matter their gender. Highlight relatable micro-moments featuring people who happen to be trans or non-binary; celebrate their passions and interests, and invite them to share some of their ideas for a photoshoot. The goal is to portray everyone honestly and reflect their truth in your photos. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/307446233/D-by-Brianna--R\" alt=\":D by Brianna  R on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/307446233/m%3D900/v2?sig=8f7ef3ca4903b760ed7d27db6ad9effc822d00e2aedc64ffbbd71e8a4f345c6c\" alt=\":D by Brianna  R on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Celebrate individuality</h2>\n<p>“Always try to consider how the images within your photo are possibly reinforcing or challenging gender stereotypes,” the Content Team advises. <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/fusion-millennial-poll-gender_n_6624200\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Most Millennials</a> believe that gender is a spectrum and that some people fall outside conventional categories, so there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to portraying gender. </p>\n<p>Approach everyone individually, and communicate with them throughout the shoot. Maybe they can bring in their favorite selfies and weigh-in on styling and grooming choices; ask them to share some of their favorite outfits and some moodboards for inspiration. You can always invite your models and collaborators to send you reference photos they love to get an idea of how they’d like to be portrayed, outside of restrictive gender stereotypes. </p>\n<h2>Get conceptual</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed keywording already, but we’ve only covered literal phrases relating to gender identity. The truth is that buyers could just as easily search for phrases that align more with ideas and emotions surrounding inclusivity and representation. The Content Team suggests, “Consider conceptual keywords or descriptions that connect to the greater struggle—terms like <em>acceptance</em>, <em>living your truth</em>, <em>strength</em>, and <em>identity</em>.”</p>\n<p>Exploring gender identity in commercial photography is more than a trend; it’s a movement that underscores the importance of representing people with dignity and integrity. The media influences almost every facet of our society; ads have the power to either reinforce harmful and exclusionary stereotypes or encourage acceptance and understanding. More and more, brands and marketers around the world are choosing to do the latter. </p>\n<p><em>*<a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/trvr_support_center/glossary/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Trevor Project</a> defines ‘gender identity’ as “our internal, personal sense of what our gender is.” Every one of us has a gender identity.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?

      "content": "\n<p>The last few years have seen a revolution in design and architecture—from smart home technology and the rise of “tiny houses” to green urban planning and the use of recycled materials. As our living and workspaces have changed, the field of architecture photography—established by legendary artists like Lucien Hervé and Julius Schulman in the 19th century—has evolved as well. </p>\n<p>These days, architecture photographers are pushing the boundaries in creative and unexpected ways. Whether they’re capturing urban density by drone or honing in on the abstract, formal details of well-known buildings, they reveal to us the nuances of our cities and towns—their rich histories and their unfathomable futures. </p>\n<p>Here’s everything you need to know about entering this dynamic genre. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/35558090/m%3D900/v2?sig=3545f30c2559e6ff64f7aad3f3bd0802d1eb56cae5a17e873693ada54055415f\" alt=\"Axelborg Staircase by Jerold Paterson on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/35558090/Axelborg-Staircase-by-Jerold-Paterson\" alt=\"Axelborg Staircase by Jerold Paterson on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What is architectural photography?</h2>\n<p>Architectural photography focuses on existing buildings and structures. This can include structures like bridges and fountains, or even entire cityscapes. </p>\n<p>Look for elements of design in the man-made structures around you. Once you understand how to look, you’ll begin to see different compositional elements everywhere, such as leading lines, symmetry, texture, and repetition. In your architecture photography, you’ll capture these existing elements in creative ways to show them in a new and interesting light. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/303529269/m%3D900/v2?sig=90a868add324621f952164830b0caeab6e42a5d0a69b5939ad0cc89793e3e411\" alt=\"Hidden Stairs #5 by Philippe Put on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/303529269/Hidden-Stairs-5-by-Philippe-Put\" alt=\"Hidden Stairs #5 by Philippe Put on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What gear will I need?</h2>\n<p>As with any genre of photography, you can get reasonably good results with a run-of-the-mill camera and your own creativity. For extraordinary shots, however, you may need to go a little further. In addition to your camera, you may consider purchasing the following:</p>\n<p>–<strong><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/780406-REG/Vello_BL_HS3_Three_Axis_Hot_Shoe_Bubble_Level.html/?ap=y&amp;ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;smp=y&amp;lsft=BI%3A514&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAt_PuBRDcARIsAMNlBdoNKK7qiTmQ-dhLq2Fc0Y8dTGx81QsUl-krb-E4T_WzrKbcw6In4fYaAqSXEALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A hot-shoe bubble level</a></strong><br>\nThis will help ensure that your camera is completely level in the field, cutting down on your post-processing time.<br>\n–<strong>A tripod and remote shutter release</strong><br>\nParticularly when shooting at night, you’ll need to keep your camera completely still for long periods of time.<br>\n–<strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=graduated+neutral+density+filter&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAt_PuBRDcARIsAMNlBdqBnBRwLBfqXCbQVzQh_Uu9da8hHVOtZ7iWauCNMdwm-gVDD-7_VTsaAsYhEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=177236640385&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9013478&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t2&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11406080560366576321&amp;hvtargid=kwd-797067832&amp;hydadcr=18504_9834440&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;ref=pd_sl_52qet04335_e%27\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A graduated neutral density (ND) filter</a></strong><br>\nThis will help control interiors with a lot of bright window light.<br>\n–<strong>A tilt-shift lens</strong><br>\nMore on this in a moment.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/209410473/m%3D900/v2?sig=f017068c427b744a13b2bb22be9049c32378eb8328d6952be72dd3e72c1f6468\" alt=\"Berlin Bibliothek by Christian Theile on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/209410473/Berlin-Bibliothek-by-Christian-Theile\" alt=\"Berlin Bibliothek by Christian Theile on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1. Finding the right camera for architectural photography</strong><br>\nYou’ll also need the right camera, of course. Fortunately, you won’t need to worry much about speed in architecture photography, but rather the ability to customize your field of view with a variety of lenses. So, look first and foremost for a DSLR, or mirrorless, that will give you the ability to use interchangeable lenses. </p>\n<p>If you’re shooting with a smartphone, you aren’t necessarily doomed to mediocre results; you just may have to work harder in post-processing and pay special attention to the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/smartphone-camera-features-that-make-you-feel-like-a-professional-photographer-2018-2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extra options in your phone camera</a>. You may also be at a disadvantage because people tend to take a big camera more seriously and show more consideration. If it looks like you’re taking a selfie, people have no problem walking in front of you.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/210398415/m%3D900/v2?sig=f99d46d51ad59ed7d78042b524c653f7a60b77280db0250fd42e87b733b4119d\" alt=\"elbphi by Ali Sahba on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/210398415/elbphi-by-Ali-Sahba\" alt=\"elbphi by Ali Sahba on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Choosing architectural photography lenses</strong><br>\nThe best lens depends on the situation. If you are shooting from an odd angle, a <strong>tilt-shift</strong> lens can help you manage the perspective in your image without physically relocating the camera. A <strong>prime lens</strong> will help with sharpness, but you’ll need to zoom with your feet. A <strong>zoom lens</strong> will give you flexibility, which is helpful in public locations where you can’t guarantee a vantage point ahead of time, but you may have to sacrifice some sharpness. It’s up to you to determine the lens features that are the highest priority.   </p>\n<h2>Six steps to capturing stunning architecture shots</h2>\n<p>There are several contributing factors to a great architectural shot: timing, place, and the different elements around the structure you’re planning to photograph. The next six steps are a checklist you can follow as you plan your first architectural photoshoot.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/211983709/m%3D900/v2?sig=9cdc8781b1e0f2a86e85940bc8ccd3971753b86894e1bfaaef8a2b68338895bc\" alt=\"start today by JasonM Peterson on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/211983709/start-today-by-JasonM-Peterson\" alt=\"start today by JasonM Peterson on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1. Find your location</strong><br>\nThe most important element of architecture photography is getting a vantage point that will do your subject justice. You’ll need to take accessibility into account when you’re scouting. For an exceptionally tall building, look for distance. For a popular location that’s likely to be crowded, brainstorm how you’ll get above the crowd.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Learn about the structure you choose</strong><br>\nLooks aren’t everything, even in photography. Some of the structures you will want to shoot may have a special history or significance. If you’re shooting a landmark that may carry a meaning you aren’t aware of (for example, a statue or monument), research it. You may be able to incorporate that bit of personality into your image.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/129522361/m%3D900/v2?sig=0fb5a57833679a6de1786daf7824473f1c94916a53589175ca2b76fb834f4a87\" alt=\"Tortuous, like life, you can go up or down, it all by nicola di maio on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/129522361/Tortuous-like-life-you-can-go-up-or-down-it-all-by-nicola-di-maio\" alt=\"Tortuous, like life, you can go up or down, it all by nicola di maio on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Use a tripod to maintain sharpness</strong><br>\nWith architecture photography, you may not have the ability to use artificial lighting to the same extent you normally would. This means you may use a lot of long shutter speeds in your shooting, so you need your camera to stay as still as possible. A tripod will also help keep your camera in the same spot in case you need to take multiple exposures to composite in post-processing later on.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/255814547/m%3D900/v2?sig=3151089991cc9dd5dbe254feadec3b6f6952315667c9a04370e5a20fbb1f29ea\" alt=\"PiecE oF LifE # by Guillaume Rio on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/255814547/PiecE-oF-LifE-by-Guillaume-Rio\" alt=\"PiecE oF LifE # by Guillaume Rio on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Mix up your timing</strong><br>\nDifferent times of the day will give you a different view, even if you’re shooting from the exact same spot. Buildings with a lot of windows may have glare at a particular time of day, or a historical monument may be too crowded to photograph properly during peak hours. Experiment with your timing to see what works and what doesn’t. </p>\n<p>In terms of light, <a href=\"https://www.photoephemeris.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Photographer’s Ephemeris</a> is a great planning tool that offers baseline knowledge of how light may behave at your location, even if your first time there is the day of your shoot.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/157131501/m%3D900/v2?sig=8e537eb6b9ba72d3c1dbe32ceaa67e7b95e24092eb8f2205f0c2cb2150f88773\" alt=\"P I N K by Eden Briand on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/157131501/P-I-N-K-by-Eden-Briand\" alt=\"P I N K by Eden Briand on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. Find different angles</strong><br>\nDon’t get caught up trying to fit the entire structure into your frame. A perfectly-centered photograph is compositionally predictable, anyway. If you prefer a centered subject, however, look for man-made or natural structures and items to frame your shot. Archways, branches, and window housings are all interesting candidates for a frame-within-a-frame. </p>\n<p>You can get even more interesting angles with a drone if you have access to one. An entire world of bird’s-eye photography will suddenly open up, or you may simply be able to get your camera into a place you might otherwise not have been able to reach.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/234068891/m%3D900/v2?sig=a02d02e11075765c7cc0fc6afec7fedd2297c45a35e9c6e91ad9cbd5a16a21e0\" alt=\"Maggie M'Gill by MBM on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/234068891/Maggie-M-Gill-by-MBM-\" alt=\"Maggie M'Gill by MBM on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. Include bystanders</strong><br>\nPeople are useful in architecture photos for demonstrating scale. A giant skyscraper looks ten times larger when you see a grown man looking minuscule next to it. You can also use people to clarify the purpose of the architecture, highlight details, or convey a mood through body language. Children climbing on the structure, or people sitting in odd places around the building can add an air of whimsy, as well.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/224044043/m%3D900/v2?sig=dd003272c7c890d05e32ea21b60f4cb3d18f86c67fd5678a8cce4c3d9e8489da\" alt=\" by Kübra Çil on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/224044043/-by-K%C3%BCbra-%C3%87il\" alt=\" by Kübra Çil on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Unique challenges in architecture photography</h2>\n<p>Although you sidestep the challenges of high-speed shooting in this particular genre, there are a few factors to plan around, like distortion and low lighting. Here are a few go-to solutions:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Manage tricky lighting with HDR</strong><br>\nYou probably won’t be able to light most exteriors yourself, so you’ll be relying heavily on available light. An HDR helps you stack your exposures to get the best version of your highlights, mid-tones, and shadows in the same shot. You simply take a series of identical frames, slightly increasing or decreasing one element of exposure each time. Then you combine the images in post-processing to get a balanced image.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/232238033/m%3D900/v2?sig=6ca40505a1e4a7ab877f7a0edf12c3538b8c02cce9c0b6c4b0285067347fb491\" alt=\"Staircase at Boijmans by Luc Vangindertael (laGrange) on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/232238033/Staircase-at-Boijmans-by-Luc-Vangindertael-laGrange-\" alt=\"Staircase at Boijmans by Luc Vangindertael (laGrange) on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Defeat distortion with lens profiles</strong><br>\nArchitecture photos are particularly prone to distortion, but that’s a quick and easy fix thanks to digital photography. Most lenses have known tendencies, which will register in Photoshop or Lightroom through the image metadata. You can easily go into the lens correction options in your software of choice and accommodate those tendencies. </p>\n<p>If you’re using a third-party lens that isn’t supported, or a software that doesn’t recognize it, you can still probably use the <strong>transform</strong> settings to skew, warp, or distort the image manually.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/238037639/m%3D900/v2?sig=16dc564b3de9b06f8c83dad85d1b7655ccfedf637f851cb8c5ae8761fd05cbe2\" alt=\"Fort Jabrin II by Piotr D?bek on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/238037639/Fort-Jabrin-II-by-Piotr-D?bek\" alt=\"Fort Jabrin II by Piotr D?bek on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Remove unnecessary people from your photo</strong><br>\nAlthough there are many reasons to include people in your architecture photography, there are an equal number of reasons you may not want them. You can choose not to include them in the first place by waiting until the shot is clear or using a long exposure so that they don’t show in the final image. </p>\n<p>If you prefer to deal with the problem in post-processing, take multiple shots at the same angle, layer them in Photoshop, and composite them using layer masks. Alternatively, you can create a new, empty layer and set your cloning tool to sample all layers, then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifhEx4adAa8\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clone (or heal)</a> the person out of your photo.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/294523725/m%3D900/v2?sig=2b81eabf871cbf544613e167b0962005db9f242063497bd237b1c43a8ea87578\" alt=\"Toronto, Canada. by Alen Palander on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/294523725/Toronto-Canada-by-Alen-Palander\" alt=\"Toronto, Canada. by Alen Palander on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Know when it’s okay to use Photoshop</strong><br>\nKnow what level of post-processing is acceptable. If you’re working for a client, get their input on what elements can stay and what can go. For real estate photography, accuracy is important. For a stock photo, you can use a little creative license to get a better composition. Again, this is important if your structure has cultural or sentimental significance. You could risk offending a lot of people by trying to “pretty up” a structure that they care deeply about just as it is.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Use post-processing to perfect your light balancing</strong><br>\nWe already explored how you may have less control over your lighting with architectural photography. You can offset this with some quick light-balancing adjustments in your editing software. Brighten your <strong>shadows</strong>, but darken your <strong>blacks</strong> to increase detail without adding muddy dark areas. Then, darken your <strong>highlights</strong> and brighten your <strong>whites</strong> ever so slightly to do the same with your brightness. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/242158397/m%3D900/v2?sig=f86114fd6622e0e32a3ffbe292bee806d131041bfd2d83552c3585abfda50ae0\" alt=\"What Goes Around by Philipp Götze on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/242158397/What-Goes-Around-by-Philipp-G%C3%B6tze\" alt=\"What Goes Around by Philipp Götze on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Taking your Architecture Photography a Step Further</h2>\n<p>Do you enjoy architectural photography enough to pursue a career in it? </p>\n<p>Look for online classes you can start taking now (<a href=\"https://www.skillshare.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Skillshare</a> and <a href=\"https://www.creativelive.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CreativeLive</a> are both great, reliable resources).

      "content": "\n<p><strong>Avoid disappointment and get the couple poses photos your couple will want and what they are hoping to see in your couple photography photographs.</strong></p>\n<p>In the world of couples photography, business is booming. From the Target-themed engagement photoshoot that went <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/target-engagement-photos-viral-2019-8\" target=\"_blank\"><u>viral</u></a> this summer to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/fashion/weddings/now-there-are-honeymoon-photographers.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>growing</u></a> popularity of hiring honeymoon photographers, the last year has been full of headlines about fun new trends taking over the industry. </p>\n<p>For couples young and old, photoshoots offer the chance to express their individuality and share their stories with the people they love. According to a 2017 survey conducted by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theknotww.com/press-releases/the-knot-2017-real-weddings-study-wedding-spend/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1572906658960000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHD_NHEH1YWbl5vu0Kys59WPBdZxg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Knot</em>,</a> 38% of couples share photos of their engagement within <em>minutes</em> or hours of popping the question. </p>\n<p>At a time where most of our photos end up lost in the cloud or on our phones, a professional photoshoot serves as a timeless, enduring reminder of cherished memories. It’s hardly any wonder that the couples photography genre is thriving. To get the most out of your next photoshoot, the 500px team has put together this guide full of cute couple poses for you to use for your couples or <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/posing-guide-ideas-couples-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wedding photography</a>. There’s something in here for everyone—from the classic to the cutting-edge. </p>\n<h3><strong>Preparing for your couples photoshoot poses</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the key things to do to prepare when doing couples photography, is to create a <a href=\"https://about.500px.com/explore/galleries/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>gallery</u></a> of photos to serve as a moodboard and to track inspirations and references. This is a helpful tool to communicate the look and style you’re going for with your clients and crew, like hair and makeup artists. </p>\n<p>Before the shoot, go over locations and wardrobe with the couple. Have a conversation without your camera first, and show them examples of photos you love, and ask for their feedback. Let their personalities dictate which poses you choose. If they have their own ideas, add them to your shot list.</p>\n<p>Get to know your couple and their dynamic before your shoot. Listen for details about how they communicate with each other and what they’re passionate about.</p>\n<h3><strong>Poses and Inspiration for Couples Photography</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Hugging and looking at the camera</strong></h4>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/135894277/m%3D900/v2?sig=b909e1c6ebbd289fe6820ea9df3b2770b8c80d1b745d225265f627d844e03054\" alt=\"Couple poses - Edit by Paul Broome on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/135894277/Edit-by-Paul-Broome\" alt=\"Couple poses - Edit by Paul Broome on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This pose is a perfect starting point for any couple’s shoot because it’s both intimate and comfortable. Just ask your models to hug as they normally would, with their faces close together. </p>\n<h4><strong>Hugging and looking at each other</strong></h4>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/168473097/m%3D900/v2?sig=32552cd33420943b667c5a019bde86d5d16e0db4ed045c9ea429d58509b8fa5f\" alt=\"Couple poses - where the water falls. by Mag Hood on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/168473097/where-the-water-falls-by-Mag-Hood\" alt=\"Couple poses - where the water falls. by Mag Hood on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>For this shot, have the couple hug and make eye contact with one another. </p>\n<h4><strong>Wide-angle</strong></h4>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/247492353/m%3D900/v2?sig=f147ce9abf8f52e5a8902004eafeb7239f068517eaad0a7adb0724631c450b56\" alt=\"Couple poses - Lonely couple on a cliff by the sea by MISHA SOTNIKOV on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/247492353/Lonely-couple-on-a-cliff-by-the-sea-by-MISHA-SOTNIKOV\" alt=\"Couple poses - Lonely couple on a cliff by the sea by MISHA SOTNIKOV on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you’re working with a couple for the first time, it can help to start from a distance before gradually moving closer.

During the golden hour, people will cast particularly long, beautiful shadows, so it’s worth taking that into account when planning your shoot.</p>\n<h4><strong>Golden hour silhouettes</strong></h4>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/76327957/m%3D900/v2?sig=1da9f9d012718c896cc55ce3807f6b4db1675bbc6a9b398d28a5fc7c8a35083c\" alt=\"Kiss me by Marcus Câmara on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/76327957/Kiss-me-by-Marcus-C%C3%A2mara\" alt=\"Kiss me by Marcus Câmara on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/63361743/m%3D900/v2?sig=accfae6e48f28f0f3a1a21d6b08f012ff42053f4a8630d4ab6b5b7ffcb14ce3f\" alt='\"forever in love\" by Rey Emilio Talam on 500px.com'></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/63361743/-forever-in-love-by-Rey-Emilio-Talam\" alt='\"forever in love\" by Rey Emilio Talam on 500px.com'></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Speaking of the golden hour, sunset is an ideal time to get dramatic, backlit silhouettes. </p>\n<h4><strong>Leaning</strong></h4>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/174490345/m%3D900/v2?sig=869be3c2b2ab885765a63a5fe379f388355ab6f79dcf4b91c328442313fcc349\" alt=\"Two cats on a rooftop by Dani Gioia on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/174490345/Two-cats-on-a-rooftop-by-Dani-Gioia\" alt=\"Two cats on a rooftop by Dani Gioia on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ask one person to lean their head on their partner’s shoulder or lap.

Ask about their favorite music before the shoot, and have it on hand on the day-of. </p>\n<h4><strong>The ‘dip’</strong></h4>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/231518831/m%3D900/v2?sig=b6dbc829ca413235a1440ad3e41b94af37f860fa691e0250716d8e79baf37e0b\" alt=\"sunset dip by Chantel Marilyn on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/231518831/sunset-dip-by-Chantel-Marilyn\" alt=\"sunset dip by Chantel Marilyn on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/35805752/m%3D900/v2?sig=9bf8bc1b9df9b798d77cc8ed564becdf0e5ba159bdb6a156de537cb66fa6ec57\" alt=\"Cliffside by Martin Reisch on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/35805752/Cliffside-by-Martin-Reisch\" alt=\"Cliffside by Martin Reisch on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few years ago, a couple made international <a href=\"https://people.com/human-interest/dip-kiss-travels-rob-joli-photo/\" target=\"_blank\">headlines</a> for recreating that Time’s Square kiss photographed by Alfred Eisenstaedt in 1945, complete with the signature “dip,” in locations around the world.

Take advantage of the rolling waves and azure sky when you compose your images.</p>\n<p>These 50 ideas are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to couple photography poses, so feel free to get creative and add your own. You can also develop several different shot lists for various occasions—couple poses for weddings, engagements, honeymoons, etc. </p>\n<p>While the poses are always important, the key ingredient to any photoshoot is the rapport between artist and subject. Create a fun, casual atmosphere on set, and encourage the couple to be themselves. During the shoot, interact with the couple by asking them to recount their first date or how they met. This will give them a chance to connect with each other and take their minds off of the shoot. </p>\n<p><b>You Might Also Like These Articles:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/a-beginners-guide-to-photography/\"><u>A Beginners Guide to Photography | The Essential Guide</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/creative-self-portraits/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>50 Creative Self-Portrait Ideas To Trump All Selfies</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sample-male-poses/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>21 Poses To Try When Photographing Men</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sample-female-poses-photographing-models/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>16 Classic and Unique Poses for Photographing Women</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/35-mobile-photography-tips-thatll-help-you-take-incredible-smartphone-shots/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>35 Mobile Photography Tips For Taking Better Smartphone Shots</u></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/posing-guide-ideas-couples-photography/\">50+ Adorable Couple Poses for Beautiful Portrait Photography</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

I was on a regular afternoon jog listening to a popular photography podcast. The topic of the episode was travel photography. The guests on the show were two professional photographers with the years of experience.</p>\n<p>At the end of the podcast, during the listener question and answer session, the first question immediately grabbed my attention. Why? Because I’ve been asked the same, or a nearly identical, question many times before.</p>\n<p>So what’s the question?</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to start traveling more specifically for photography, but I do not know where to start. Do you have any idea where I should go or how to plan my trip? Should I edit photos while I am there or should I wait until I return home? What cameras, lenses and other equipment do I take? Help! I am suffering from analysis paralysis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ok, so perhaps the question has multiple parts but it still rang true to my experience. I was curious to hear the answers because I knew it was a loaded question and definitely not an easy one.</p>\n<p>The pro photographers’ answers surprised me.</p>\n<p>Here are some of them:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“South Asia is a good place to go.”<br>\n“Do not go to Bangkok.”<br>\n“If you do not know, choose a place randomly.”<br>\n“Europe, maybe.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead of addressing the complex subject of travel photography, the photographers only concentrated on a single aspect: the location. Their answers disappointed me because I do not consider the location to be the essential part of travel photography. You do not need to travel to a remote and exotic destination to enjoy travel photography.</p>\n<p>So I’ve decided to put together a blueprint or guide to help people who want to get involved in travel photography, but do not know where to start. I used a similar approach when I first started and it has proven successful over the years.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, please do not start your travel photography journey with a trip to South Asia. It will be a waste of time and money, not to mention it will be full of disappointments.</p>\n<p>Start smaller and grow from there.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/83418519/m%3D900/86286a8c7ab3cdb3cdf9c36be4f5192b\" alt=\"Sunrise at Forillon National Park by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/83418519/sunrise-at-forillon-national-park-by-viktor-elizarov\" alt=\"Sunrise at Forillon National Park by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Testing Ground</h2>\n<p>Find a local park in your neighborhood, preferably within walking distance or a short drive. Make this your testing ground for your equipment and photography routines.</p>\n<p>Any urban park has all the essential elements of travel photography: landscapes, cityscapes, people, etc…</p>\n<p>Plan your visits during different times of the day. Learn how to deal with the harsh midday light, overcast, rain, sunsets, and sunrises. In doing so, you will figure out what minimum equipment you need to cover different scenarios of travel photography.</p>\n<p>For example, I realized pretty early on that a minimalistic approach to photography suits me the best, and all I need is a camera with a walk-around lens. For years, I used a combination of a Canon 60D + Sigma 17-70mm and now I have a similar setup of a Sony a6000 + Sony 16-70mm.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I have more equipment in my possession including a wide angle lens (Sony 10-18mm), tripod, filters, and remote triggers. But, if necessary, I can go on an extensive trip and only take a camera and one lens with me.</p>\n<p>I am lucky enough to have a beautiful park only a short, walkable distance from where I live. Even now, when I have a new piece of equipment, I always test it there. When I switched from a Canon to a Sony it was a steep learning curve, and the local park was the ideal place for learning about and testing my new equipment.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/125743947/m%3D900/2e386f95cf69d4e0baee8f86bd7e4f20\" alt=\"Colorful Fall Evening (Montreal) by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/125743947/colorful-fall-evening-montreal-by-viktor-elizarov\" alt=\"Colorful Fall Evening (Montreal) by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Park Rene Levesque in Montreal is my testing ground</p>\n<h2>Mini Simulation</h2>\n<p>The next step is to go on a day-long trip to a location within about 1-2 hours drive. In my case, I know all the national and provincial parks around Montreal and most of them make perfect destinations for short photo trips.</p>\n<p>This trip will take you away from the comfort of your home for the entire day, and will allow you to start micro planning and testing your skills.</p>\n<p>Make sure you plan in advance what spot to visit at sunset or sunrise. It is not always easy to do both during a short trip, so choose only one and make sure you visit the best spot. Use Google search, Google maps, and <a href=\"http://500px.com/\">500px</a> to pinpoint the perfect location for your sunrise or sunset shoot.</p>\n<p>Also, you have to decide how many camera batteries to bring with you, if you need spare memory cards, and so on. If your trip involves challenging hiking, it also might be a good idea to leave the tripod at home.</p>\n<p>These trips are designed for photographers to make mistakes and learn. With every new trip, you will learn more about planning, your equipment, and your habits.</p>\n<p>When you’re comfortable with the short trips, it is time to graduate to multi-day trips.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/86487125/m%3D900/fe0bd80a6cd44e0dace0d875e48cf8a6\" alt=\"Path to Golden Forest (Montreal) by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/86487125/path-to-golden-forest-montreal-by-viktor-elizarov\" alt=\"Path to Golden Forest (Montreal) by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mont-Saint-Bruno national park is only 30km from Montreal</p>\n<h2>Multi-day Driving Trips</h2>\n<p>This is how real travel photography started for me.</p>\n<p>Montreal is located about 5-7 hours drive from New York, Boston, and Toronto with Niagara Falls. My trips dedicated exclusively to photography started with 2-3 day driving trips to those destinations.</p>\n<p>Multi-days trips require much more planning where you should always do your research first and then plan all your sunrises, sunsets and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Another new challenge you have to face on these trips is to figure out how to deal with editing and backups.</p>\n<p>I am not giving you a specific scenario to follow because, based on my experience, travel routines are always changing and evolving.</p>\n<p>For example, in the beginning, I always did some basic edits of my new photos by the end of every day of the trip; now, I only concentrate on my shooting and I start the editing process when I am back at home. But I always have the option to edit photos simply by connecting my tablet to my camera using Wi-Fi, grabbing a few photos, editing them with Snapseed, and posting them to social media.</p>\n<p>At the same time, my backup routine has not changed a lot. By the end of the day, I backup all new photos to two external hard drives and always make sure to keep them in two separate places. I have one with me at all times in my bag and the second I keep in the safe in the hotel or in the trunk of my car.</p>\n<p>Also, I do not rush to format my memory cards. I keep photos on the cards until I run out of space on all four of them and only then do I start formatting.</p>\n<p>The beauty of driving trips is that you do not have to be too selective about the equipment you bring with you. You can load your trunk with everything you own and figure out what pieces are essential for your style of photography later.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/64875885/m%3D900/87132f5ab6147630f3de4e79b9bbc074\" alt=\"East River Sunset Shower (New York) by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/64875885/east-river-sunset-shower-new-york-by-viktor-elizarov\" alt=\"East River Sunset Shower (New York) by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>New York. Taken during a sunset cruise along the East River.</p>\n<h2>Hacking Family Vacation</h2>\n<p>The next step is to hack your family vacation.</p>\n<p>You have to be careful with this one so as to ensure you do not agitate your loved ones or ruin the vacation for them.</p>\n<p>A family trip can serve as the perfect opportunity for testing your air travel routines. It requires additional research to figure out carry on allowances on every leg of your trip and decide what equipment to bring.</p>\n<p>After I brought all my equipment on one of my first family trips to Cuba and hardly used any of it, I started to pack differently by bringing only the necessities along. Also, after I switched from DSLR to Mirrorless, I can pack everything (almost everything) in my carry on without worrying about lost luggage.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/57799994/m%3D900/06b2dab24633dc0d475e5c2e57dd8e84\" alt=\"Sunrise Watchers at Cayo Coco Beach by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/57799994/sunrise-watchers-at-cayo-coco-beach-by-viktor-elizarov\" alt=\"Sunrise Watchers at Cayo Coco Beach by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cuba. Sunrise at Cayo Coco beach.</p>\n<p>So how do you start planning?</p>\n<p>Begin by planning your vacation as you normally would and concentrate on family activities first. When these are done and everybody is happy, you can enhance your trip with photography adventures.</p>\n<p>During the vacation, the only time when you can be 100% dedicated to your photography is when everybody is sleeping. On each day of vacation, you will have a few hours between sunrise and breakfast to concentrate on your photography. And, not only will your family be in bed at 5am, so will about 99.9% of tourists. </p>\n<p>In fact, you would be surprised how beautiful Venice looks at sunrise—it is completely different and calm without the chaos of crowds.</p>\n<p>Last year, my wife and I  went to Niagara Falls in the middle of summer on a weekend getaway. It was so crowded during the day that I had no chance of using a tripod. It was even difficult to take any pictures without having people in the frame. But, when I went to the Falls the next morning just before sunrise, I had the entire place to myself. The only person I met there was another photographer who had the same idea.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/84349089/m%3D900/b24692f38d9bdc2e28a17e4a8a1fb0e4\" alt=\"Sunrise at Niagara Falls by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/84349089/sunrise-at-niagara-falls-by-viktor-elizarov\" alt=\"Sunrise at Niagara Falls by Viktor Elizarov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The key to successfully combining a family vacation with photography and enjoying them both is to plan every single sunrise in advance. The rest of the days will be dedicated to family activities, and are much more difficult to plan around. You can enjoy your family while trying to be as opportunistic as possible with your photography.</p>\n<p>After you have completed dozens of one-day local trips, half a dozen short driving trips, and at least a couple of family vacations, you will be ready to go on extensive trips dedicated exclusively to photography. </p>\n<p>You will have acquired the necessary skills and established the personal routines that will help you be comfortable, confident, and safe during your travels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bag.jpg\" alt=\"bag\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30452\" srcset=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bag.jpg 800w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bag-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phototraces.com/reviews/whats-in-my-camera-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">Check what’s in my camera bag…</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Learning any new complex process requires breaking it down into smaller digestible chunks that you can then start to tackle one at a time.

      "content": "\n<p>In 1860, the early English photographer Roger Fenton faced a new challenge when confined to his home due to terrible, unpredictable weather. The renowned landscape photographer suddenly found himself cut off from the gorgeous countryside, unable to produce the kinds of pictures that had made him famous. But instead of packing away the camera, he began to create lush still lives indoors, using lilies, ferns, roses, grapes, and plums to create bountiful arrangements. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/collection/highlights/fenton-fruit-and-flowers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Those simple still lifes</a>, made at the end of Fenton’s short photographic career, remain some of the most iconic pictures in recent history, rivaling even his epic landscapes. More than a century and a half later, they still feel fresh and modern. Right now, during a time when so many of us are isolated in our homes, Roger Fenton’s story serves as a powerful reminder that the simplest objects and the most modest of means can form the foundation for extraordinary images. </p>\n<p>The still life genre, of course, comprises all images featuring inanimate subjects, from food to objects found around the house. Still life photographs can include any item that does not move (e.g., office supplies, kitchen utensils, etc.) or has died (e.g., cut or pressed flowers, plucked fruits). Here are our tips for getting the most out of this timeless niche. Throughout, we’ve included examples from the 500px community to inspire you along the way. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1015160516/De-azules-y-amarillos-by-Bel%C3%A9n-Arg%C3%BCeso-\" alt=\"De azules y amarillos..... by Belén Argüeso  on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1015160516/m%3D900/v2?sig=1fa24ede5b3aac0fde781edbe6de171deb506750b3e2dec887570efd08a6f596\" alt=\"De azules y amarillos..... by Belén Argüeso  on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Develop a strong idea</h2>\n<p>Still lives, whether painted or photographed, often speak in allegory. When Man Ray photographed a <a href=\"https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/46738/man-ray-dead-leaf-american-1942/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dead castor bean leaf</a> in 1942, for example, he famously made it look like a hand or a claw so as to reference our mortality and the preciousness of life. More recently, photographers like <a href=\"https://500px.com/arken\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dina Belenko</a> have created still lives inspired by imagined characters, sometimes referencing specific painters and movements from art history. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/259108105/Sea-Collection-Part-2-by-Dina-Belenko\" alt=\"Sea Collection. Part 2 by Dina Belenko on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/259108105/m%3D900/v2?sig=d8d4b0a2e7f8125ee8eae5659cb2bde58310987a66af4b13c6c59061bf05a960\" alt=\"Sea Collection. Part 2 by Dina Belenko on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still lives can be straightforward formal studies on the surface, but more often than not, they also hint at larger hidden meanings. Maybe, in the tradition of Man Ray, you take an everyday object and turn it into something else, or perhaps you allude to a work of fiction or literature. Once you have your initial concept, refine it, and add as many details as you can. The more fleshed out your idea, the easier it will be to bring to life. </p>\n<p>For some brainstorming ideas, be sure to check out Dina’s <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/still-life-photography-ideas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">still life how-to guide</a>. </p>\n<h2>Choose a style</h2>\n<p>One advantage of shooting still lives is that you have maximum control over not only the light and composition but also the mood and atmosphere of your work. As Paul Martineau, associate curator of photographs at the J. Paul Getty Museum, once put it, the true magic of this genre lies in the fact that it can be as conventional or experimental as you wish. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1001484269/Popsicle-collection-by-Marina-Kuznetcova\" alt=\"Popsicle collection by Marina Kuznetcova on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1001484269/m%3D900/v2?sig=f1d53892ea1e614de0617bad497cbaa19786694ed9cac816dedf434ac9e9d2f4\" alt=\"Popsicle collection by Marina Kuznetcova on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>More traditional still lives might follow in the vein of 17th-century European paintings, where imported flowers and fruits represented the earth’s rich and decadent pleasures. On the other hand, you can take a pop-art inspired approach with bright colors and mundane, everyday objects. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1014500460/Ripe-decorative-pumpkins-on-a-colored-background-by-Valentin-Ivantsov\" alt=\"Ripe decorative pumpkins on a colored background by Valentin Ivantsov on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1014500460/m%3D900/v2?sig=fec2bab80e0a2de1a7bb9c704c70284432fbbba43a43bd80f98949f6879de686\" alt=\"Ripe decorative pumpkins on a colored background by Valentin Ivantsov on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perhaps you opt for a cookbook-worthy food shot, or you use found objects from thrift or antique stores and repurpose them in unusual and surprising ways, or you create a portrait of a specific place by arranging various souvenirs from your travels. You can go high-key with bright light and few shadows or low key with dark and muted tones. Select an aesthetic that works with your concept, and pull some photos from 500px for creative inspiration. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/309656231/Flatlay-with-womans-hands-covered-in-paint-holding-brush-and-palette-and-other-artists-by-Nataly-Lavrenkova\" alt=\"Flatlay with woman's hands covered in paint holding brush and palette and other artist's... by Nataly Lavrenkova on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/309656231/m%3D900/v2?sig=6c768e8de8ead64923198192101c1f5bf6492cae68f21b951b756c9e704b149a\" alt=\"Flatlay with woman's hands covered in paint holding brush and palette and other artist's... by Nataly Lavrenkova on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Perfect your composition</h2>\n<p>When shooting still lives, feel free to take your time planning and refining your composition. Consider conventions like the <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/rule-of-thirds/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rule of thirds</a>, leading lines, or the rule of odds, which dictates that an odd number of objects (e.g., three or five) makes for a more dynamic image than an even number (e.g., two or four). Weigh the pros and cons of using a traditional tabletop composition (shot from the side) versus a flat-lay, where every object appears on the same plane. </p>\n<p>If you want to create floating objects, bring out your glue gun, or incorporate strings and toothpicks. Toy blocks, modeling clay, poster putty, and coins can also help you balance objects and perfect their positions. If you’re using your hands, wear gloves to avoid smudges and fingerprints. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/268415313/A-Couple-Cup-of-Tea-on-Satin-by-Hardi-Saputra\" alt=\"A Couple Cup of Tea on Satin by Hardi Saputra on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/268415313/m%3D900/v2?sig=11579d5c551b3bec22827fd4287e1a53b413cd4baa38773f62f752a98bfcb70a\" alt=\"A Couple Cup of Tea on Satin by Hardi Saputra on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Color will also play a role in your composition, so think about what hues work well together, and use saturated colors to draw attention to specific parts of your photo. You can fill the frame, or you can make a statement with plenty of negative space. Play with scale by placing a large object and a small one side-by-side, or introduce two seemingly disparate, juxtaposing elements to pique our interest. </p>\n<p>Once you’re on set, use a tripod and maybe even a remote shutter release to free up your hands for some finessing and rearranging as you go. For convenience, you can start with one object, light it well, and gradually add others as the shoot progresses. </p>\n<h2>Use light modifiers</h2>\n<p>Tabletop still lives date back to the Dutch golden age, when painters like Pieter Claesz and Floris van Dyck set up common food and drinks on wooden surfaces. For these kinds of still lives, it might be worth experimenting with natural window light; schedule your shoot for overcast days or <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/golden-hour-photography-tips-tricks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the golden hour</a>, and use a white curtain to diffuse the sunlight. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1014432564/spring-pictures-by-Mykhailo-Sherman\" alt=\"spring pictures by Mykhailo Sherman on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1014432564/m%3D900/v2?sig=2c3d2b22a13c1bdb8f83389faf07c184d4c9530376b255fb927fa38b843ef7cc\" alt=\"spring pictures by Mykhailo Sherman on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you plan to shoot product photos for a commercial client, you might opt instead for an off-camera flash and softbox for more power. A portable light source will also give you the freedom to move around; use backlight for silhouettes, or create some side-lighting to highlight textures.  </p>\n<p>Modifiers like reflectors to bounce the light or gels and filters to change its temperature will also come in handy, and you can use flags to block out the light or create shadows where you want them. Photographers have been experimenting with modifiers for generations—around the turn of the 20th century, the photographer Baron Adolf de Meyer even placed a thin scrim in front of a set of glassware to make his pictures look more like paintings or etchings—so feel free to try new things. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/187773529/Watermelon-three-ways-by-Franz-Weber\" alt=\"Watermelon three ways by Franz Weber on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/187773529/m%3D900/v2?sig=1419fa9e0e0e085cd6516c496d0cdd91712495c0cc1b822bceb6067815449cc2\" alt=\"Watermelon three ways by Franz Weber on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Try out different lenses</h2>\n<p>Although cameras with a live-view LCD can be ideal for still-lives, you can create these kinds of photos with any camera on the market, from a point-and-shoot to an old film camera to a DSLR. More often than not, your lens can also help to determine the overall appearance and aesthetic of your photo. </p>\n<p>Early still life photographs often had a hazy, gauzy look reminiscent of painting and brushstrokes, and you can still get that look today. Select a fast lens with a wide aperture for a shallow depth of field; once you’ve focused on your subject, the background will be thrown out of focus, creating a dreamy, blurred aesthetic. An affordable prime lens like a classic “nifty-fifty” will serve you well in most cases. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/214299863/??-by-????-\" alt=\"?? by ????  on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/214299863/m%3D900/v2?sig=6b411814c37ab5156b78d15b2c252c240de0694c9cbc78df974e8d1d8845dcb6\" alt=\"?? by ????  on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, you want close-up photos, you might consider opting for a macro lens. These can be ideal for highlighting tiny details that are invisible to the human eye, bringing new life and layers to even banal subjects. If you find your depth of field to be too shallow, use a focus-stacking technique in post. </p>\n<p>In general, you won’t need a wide-angle lens for still lives, as you won’t be shooting vast areas, and you’ll want to avoid any unnatural distortions. Whatever lens you choose, use manual settings if you can for the most creative control possible. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/296044285/the-four-by-Natalia-Balanina\" alt=\"the four by Natalia Balanina on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/296044285/m%3D900/v2?sig=c8df489ec4e7a955642ab7d493e6bba3cab37ce14b26da9f98745960c7c0d1f0\" alt=\"the four by Natalia Balanina on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Get creative with backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Your choice in background will set the scene for your still life shoot, whether you choose to have it in focus or not. While professional seamless paper works well for commercial shoots (especially if you want to isolate your subject), you can also play with rustic wood or stone backgrounds. </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that shiny surfaces will create reflections; these can work well in product photography but often prove difficult to control, so if they’re causing issues, feel free to use some dulling spray on set. Velvet or velour, on the other hand, will absorb light. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/215093501/Cherries-by-Raquel-Carmona-Romero\" alt=\"Cherries by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/215093501/m%3D900/v2?sig=97d72539935c68f3b63feac9291e6001d910179065c73022770588c95c66d759\" alt=\"Cherries by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some cases, wallpapers or even a painted canvas could also add texture and bring out the colors of your scene. Alternatively, you can build miniature setups or stage sets using cardboard and fabric.

      "content": "\n<p>In 1797, the engraver and painter John Thomas Smith, who worked as the keeper of prints at the British Museum, came up with a revolutionary theory. </p>\n<p>In his view, landscape paintings worked best not when sky and land were given equal weight, but when one or the other took up an entire two-thirds of the canvas. Contrary to popular wisdom, which favored the “formal half” or a one-to-one ratio, he wondered if the most appealing compositions, in fact, featured a different ratio altogether: one-to-two.    </p>\n<p>Smith’s theory predates the invention of the camera by about twenty years, but these days, we know it as one of the guiding principles of photography. Now, when we discuss composition, we still use the same term Smith coined all those years ago: the rule of thirds.</p>\n<p>Once you understand this common photographic technique, you can learn to position your subject in any image so that the photo is both visually balanced and interesting to your viewers. In this article, we’ll explore the rule of thirds and how you can use it to your advantage. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/235211923/m%3D900/v2?sig=460ea597f1e362fcfea5e6a1689596d4a3a2fd909f4a185d6960c2098f666124\" alt=\"DSC by Masai Okeda on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/235211923/DSC-by-Masai-Okeda\" alt=\"DSC by Masai Okeda on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What is the rule of thirds?</h2>\n<p>The rule of thirds is one of the easiest ways to experiment with your composition; it is simply a matter of placing the elements in your image so that each of them carries the proper amount of visual weight. </p>\n<p>Imagine you are looking at a tic-tac-toe board. Notice how the lines on that board create three distinct horizontal sections and three distinct vertical sections. There are also four points where the lines intersect. According to the rule of thirds, placing your subject along a line or point on this grid will create a more dynamic composition. </p>\n<p>You have the option to view a rule of thirds grid as an overlay in your DSLR viewfinder, and you can even look for a grid option in the camera settings on your phone. This can be helpful when you’re practicing the rule of thirds, but be wary of using it too much as it may interfere with your ability to visualize other compositions while you shoot. The best way to master the rule of thirds is to practice visualizing it in your mind.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/298061267/m%3D900/v2?sig=67c8c25fa3666aa670e5e2b87ef3dac5b793a0bbe592596f18704d17210ca743\" alt=\"strawberry greenhouses by Leyla Emektar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/298061267/strawberry-greenhouses-by-Leyla-Emektar\" alt=\"strawberry greenhouses by Leyla Emektar on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How to use the rule of thirds</h2>\n<p>New photographers tend to put their subjects in the very center of the frame. While this can result in a strong composition under the right circumstances, it can also create static images that lack interest. </p>\n<p>This is partly due to the way our eyes view a scene: they naturally try to follow the lines and points on the grid, even when the grid is not visible. It’s also due to another compositional element: balanced asymmetry. Usually, your subject will already carry the greatest impact out of all the elements in your image, so it wields a lot of visual weight. By positioning the subject so that it takes up approximately one-third of the image, you’re leaving enough negative space to balance that weight.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/311634229/m%3D900/v2?sig=446b0a5bcd45e77c0097cb3ae8a2fc159fef7fd4422e92cb365e75a8ba1ee9a4\" alt=\"The Lavender Fields by Nuno Morais on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/311634229/The-Lavender-Fields-by-Nuno-Morais\" alt=\"The Lavender Fields by Nuno Morais on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>In landscapes</strong><br>\nTry aligning your horizon line with one of the two horizontal lines on the grid. This keeps your viewer’s eye from getting stuck going side to side. If the sky is distractingly bright, this is an easy way to balance that punch of brightness with the more muted detail in the land portion of your image. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/311389969/m%3D900/v2?sig=40ae8b8b191410cd4f5beab9e01ae2f84a33a18e9e0d528f23e547aa2bbd395b\" alt=\"Kavya by Mercedes Castillo Sánchez on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/311389969/Kavya-by-Mercedes-Castillo-S%C3%A1nchez\" alt=\"Kavya by Mercedes Castillo Sánchez on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>In portraiture</strong><br>\nThe eyes are usually the focus of a portrait, so try to line up your model’s eyes along the grid to give them high visual exposure. For group portraits, use stools, steps, or natural height strategically to utilize different areas of the grid.</p>\n<h2>Some things to consider</h2>\n<p>The rule of thirds is a great “cheat sheet” for getting dynamic compositions out of almost any scene. However, it’s not always the best choice for every photo. If you’re shooting in one of the following circumstances, the rule of thirds might not be right for your image. </p>\n<p><strong>You want something to have a larger-than-life effect</strong><br>\nPlaton is famous for his <a href=\"https://www.digitalphotopro.com/profiles/platon-master-of-the-portrait-of-power/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in-your-face portraits</a> of celebrities and world leaders. You really get a sense of who they are, and for that kind of impact, the subject is the only thing that matters. Although some of his other work does use the rule of thirds, these pieces would only be hindered by it.</p>\n<p><strong>If you already use the rule of thirds too frequently</strong><br>\nThis rule is meant to stimulate creativity, not inhibit it. If you’ve come to rely heavily on the rule of thirds and notice that a lot of your work is looking eerily similar, it may be time to try something new.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re battling lens distortion</strong><br>\nIf you’re using a wide-angle lens, placing your subject in one of the outer thirds could cause them to appear too distorted. If that’s not the effect you are going for, switch lenses or switch photography rules. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/267967205/m%3D900/v2?sig=21f0af72bef8d1d4c1e172a9519d32de5d1b4e634235f2bc4f73278973a0a68d\" alt=\"Floating on Lovatnet by Arnas Goldberg on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/267967205/Floating-on-Lovatnet-by-Arnas-Goldberg\" alt=\"Floating on Lovatnet by Arnas Goldberg on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The rule of thirds in post-processing</h2>\n<p>Sometimes we want a rule of thirds composition, but due to shooting circumstances, it’s not easy or possible on-location. If you’re shooting macro photography of insects, for example, you’re already using a lot of mental energy just to get the right point of focus before your subject moves on. In a situation like that, it can help to shoot just a little wider than you think you need. That leaves you room to crop for the rule of thirds in post-processing. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/163388595/m%3D900/v2?sig=cf049d59333a1042399e1ef4541b76eb099daee97b2cf345e8363ea355d8df75\" alt=\"Perovskia by Elena Andreeva on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/163388595/Perovskia-by-Elena-Andreeva-\" alt=\"Perovskia by Elena Andreeva on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you plan to do this, check your camera settings before you shoot. Be sure you are shooting in RAW and give yourself a nice, high-resolution file to work with so that you aren’t cropping away all of your image quality. Keep a copy of the original image in your backups in case you need to go back to the drawing board. </p>\n<p>If you simply want to enhance the rule of thirds effect, you can use an adjustment layer mask (or in Lightroom, an adjustment brush) to draw attention to elements that line up with the grid. You can add a little pop of saturation, enhance the brightness, or do some selective sharpening to draw attention to those areas.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p> <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/311817653/m%3D900/v2?sig=b2cec5443f80b8b5c6f82a2385938c8cdc3f5e2e892ce76cbcf5c73acf96f73d\" alt=\"Santa Maria della Pietà di Calascio (28309) by daniele nobile on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/311817653/Santa-Maria-della-Piet%C3%A0-di-Calascio-28309-by-daniele-nobile\" alt=\"Santa Maria della Pietà di Calascio (28309) by daniele nobile on 500px.com\"></a> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Practice is all it takes to master this rule completely. Try setting up a dedicated shoot for this technique and see how many different compositions you can think of. When you walk around without your camera, try visualizing compositions from the things you see around you that follow the rule of thirds. You can also gain a lot of inspiration from finding examples of images that use the rule of thirds to analyze.</p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/rule-of-thirds/\">How to improve your photography with the rule of thirds</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

Simply put, complementary color pairs consist of one primary plus the secondary color you get when you mix the other two primaries. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1003204687/m%3D900/v2?sig=63216833c6dc3f0a31b1c637d37970ce264763540b3e72037fca77efe6e22b01\" alt=\"Al Natural by Angela Perez on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1003204687/Al-Natural--by-Angela-Perez\" alt=\"Al Natural by Angela Perez on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Yellow and purple</em></p>\n<p>Try this: stare for several moments at a block or pattern of solid color, and then redirect your eyes to a white wall. On that white wall, you’re likely to see an afterimage of the complement of the color you’ve just observed. Red will produce a green block on the wall; blue will produce an orange one, and so on. </p>\n<p>In photography, as we’ve discussed in our <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/color-theory-photographers-introduction-color-wheel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduction to color theory</a>, complementary colors look good together because they “boost” each other’s intensity. The painter Josef Albers was a master when it came to using color; because color is relative, he regularly instructed his students to use colored paper to explore how different hues interacted with—and changed—each other. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1006819652/m%3D900/v2?sig=6a9d3e7540d755530ac4446fd2c729c6969d34988d6b1068539f1c476db37c2f\" alt=\"Dusk Dreaming by Lizzy Gadd on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1006819652/Dusk-Dreaming-by-Lizzy-Gadd\" alt=\"Dusk Dreaming by Lizzy Gadd on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Blue and orange</em></p>\n<p>Here’s another exercise you can try with colored paper or on your computer: place a square of orange next to its complement (blue), and it will take on a different appearance than it would when placed next to, say, another shade of orange. By doing this exercise—developed by Albers—you’ll notice that it’s possible to make just three colors look like four, and that’s a testament to the power of complementary colors. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/245371561/m%3D900/v2?sig=68b4b94e3c4917c5fc0fac2555b504f3b77b14401db4c564a69db7b16b9c6dad\" alt=\"Amorphous III by Inna Mosina on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/245371561/Amorphous-III-by-Inna-Mosina\" alt=\"Amorphous III by Inna Mosina on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Red and green</em></p>\n<p>You can also practice by taking a simple object and setting it against a seamless background with a complementary hue. </p>\n<p>If you’ve chosen a red apple, try placing it against a green backdrop. If you don’t have a roll of seamless paper, some construction paper or fabric should do the trick. You can also paint the objects themselves to complement whatever background you have.

These sets of colors are similar to regular complementary sets, but they’re less intense; to use a split-complementary scene, identify your key color, and then pair it with the colors on either side of its complement. For example, if you’ve chosen purple as your key color, perhaps you choose yellow-green and yellow-orange instead of pure yellow for a softer vibe. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/273182553/m%3D900/v2?sig=804d1aad4ed08acbda4d640e8f9130b96c2ae90673a56b651d58c148e7717c8a\" alt=\"love by Jennifer Kapala on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/273182553/love-by-Jennifer-Kapala\" alt=\"love by Jennifer Kapala on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Purple, yellow-green, and yellow-orange</em></p>\n<p>When working with color, it’s also important to recognize that hues are both timeless and trendy.

That percentage increases when we look specifically at younger diners, especially among Gen Z and Millennials. When it comes to advertising in this day and age, brands understand that food photography is one of the most powerful tools they have at their disposal. When used correctly, it can be a determining factor in attracting new customers. </p>\n<p>In recent years, photogenic foods like “unicorn toast,” “rainbow bagels,” and “sushi donuts” have flooded our social media feeds, whetted our appetites, and influenced viral ad campaigns. It’s an exciting time to be a commercial food photographer, so we decided to take a look at how the industry and its aesthetics have evolved—and where they’re heading in the coming years.

A great way to get a feel for this kind of contemporary food photography is to look at top food blogs and social media feeds, where the work tends to feel more approachable and relatable. </p>\n<p>You don’t need an elaborate studio setup or a big budget to capture appetizing images; instead, use a simple softbox or—even better—find a room at home with beautiful, natural light and use curtains to diffuse it.* </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/231440807/m%3D900/v2?sig=1bbd4ffea7c6691733d1202104f8ace704f0159b17e5c8aae241166e765d3970\" alt=\"Ingredients for vitamin winter drink by Alina Kholopova on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/231440807/Ingredients-for-vitamin-winter-drink-by-Alina-Kholopova\" alt=\"Ingredients for vitamin winter drink by Alina Kholopova on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Natural food styling is also on the rise, so don’t feel obligated to capture the “picture-perfect” aesthetic.

Behind-the-scenes photos of raw cookie dough or homemade pasta can be just as powerful as the final shot. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/135820893/m%3D900/v2?sig=b4387ed5add9d58207a4b44d4207fbcc28816f6367780855a32b49df28b32d10\" alt=\"matcha pancakes w/ brown sugar syrup. by Miki Fujii on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/135820893/matcha-pancakes-w-brown-sugar-syrup-by-Miki-Fujii\" alt=\"matcha pancakes w/ brown sugar syrup. by Miki Fujii on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>You might want to consider cooking your food a little less than you normally would, as overcooking can affect the color and “juiciness” of your dishes on camera. After you’re done shooting, you can always pop it back in the oven before eating it. Remember to buy extra ingredients as well; even after you’re done cooking, these extras can serve as pretty props or garnishes. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/270618949/m%3D900/v2?sig=dce7864ec092c40c70d4526aeedcf562d54efb3532d68175411f01cf12e0cbc6\" alt=\"bite breakfast cake by ahsan Khan on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/270618949/bite-breakfast-cake-by-ahsan-Khan\" alt=\"bite breakfast cake by ahsan Khan on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Include a personal touch</h2>\n<p>If the popular Instagram hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/foodwithaview/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#FoodWithAView</a> has taught us anything, it’s that food photography is about so much more than just the food itself. It’s also about the setting and the context. </p>\n<p>Eating is a social activity, and so consider including people in your photos—whether it’s a hand selecting fresh fruits from a grocery store or a group of friends passing dishes around the table. Invite people over for a day of cooking, baking, and taste-testing, and don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty in the process. A casual home-cooked meal with family can provide the perfect opportunity to capture immersive photos of people preparing and eating the food. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1001946273/m%3D900/v2?sig=9300285aa66f4c74c405e064fc2fb7389827e26927e33aadcf39e6ec7499e56d\" alt=\"Breakfast #1 by callmedj on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1001946273/Breakfast-1-by-callmedj-\" alt=\"Breakfast #1 by callmedj on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Make sure you have everyone in your photoshoot sign <a href=\"http://static.500px.net/docs/ModelReleaseForm.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a model release</a> before you start—you need them if you want to license your images for commercial use, and they’re relatively straightforward and easy to complete.

This trick works especially well during the preparation process, when you’re drizzling sauces onto the plate, pouring a glass of lemonade, or sprinkling sugar onto your baked goods. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/308863629/m%3D900/v2?sig=6d53748a8f51cc701b6cc6432c264b2669aec58b6e965bcef57aead0bf4b52f7\" alt=\"Eating spaghetti stock photo by Metwara Narksook on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/308863629/Eating-spaghetti-stock-photo-by-Metwara-Narksook\" alt=\"Eating spaghetti stock photo by Metwara Narksook on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tap into foodie culture</h2>\n<p>Staying up-to-date on culinary trends can get your creative juices flowing—and boost the marketability of your photos. This year’s emerging trends range from alcohol-free “mocktails” and kombucha to nut butter and plant-based meat alternatives. As reported by <a href=\"https://creativeinsights.gettyimages.com/en/trends/trend/return-of-the-carb\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Getty Images</a>, customer searches for bread and carbs are also on the rise, so think about incorporating trendy ingredients like rice flour or spelt into your photos. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/257094351/m%3D900/v2?sig=3774e7f467bc979ae58b4eb2ac62ecf966ff457b44dad1599d018fc790e92cfe\" alt=\"Sugar by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/257094351/Sugar-by-Raquel-Carmona-Romero\" alt=\"Sugar by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Go international</h2>\n<p>From Filipino desserts to Taiwanese recipes and West African grains, many of today’s food trends highlight traditional cuisines and ingredients. <a href=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/48606515_2199769090237778_5979666736092282880_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;_nc_ohc=RhIPnTY5INcAX_d7eua&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.xx&amp;oh=42563684d7963dff3292958370372bfa&amp;oe=5EDBD939\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook’s 2019 Topics &amp; Trends Report</a> pointed to an increased interest in diverse and multicultural foods; sales of international cooking equipment are booming, and more than a third of families with young children say their kids enjoy international foods. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/175772427/m%3D900/v2?sig=73ad9e1cd686b93aa614cda9526554ae1ada24b8dbddca16438ffe5387ab0556\" alt=\"Sushi and sashimi variety on rustic background by Alena Haurylik on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/175772427/Sushi-and-sashimi-variety-on-rustic-background-by-Alena-Haurylik\" alt=\"Sushi and sashimi variety on rustic background by Alena Haurylik on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>For commercial food photographers, tapping into local cuisine and culture will be especially important in the coming years, whether you’re traveling abroad or cooking at home. Use colors, textures, and props to pay homage to regional dishes and local specialties. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/282951979/m%3D900/v2?sig=5a359ea1408fcbce53d8cb618321cefabe0d781a5d53bb8607057c9581c81c4c\" alt=\"Food fashion food pattern with grapefruits by Valeria Aksakova on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/282951979/Food-fashion-food-pattern-with-grapefruits-by-Valeria-Aksakova\" alt=\"Food fashion food pattern with grapefruits by Valeria Aksakova on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Play with minimalism</h2>\n<p>The “minimal” trend might have started on social media with popular hashtags like #MindtheMinimal, #MinimalMood, and #IG_Minimalistic, but in recent years, it’s fully entered the commercial sphere. Experimenting with minimalism can help refine your eye and add variety to your portfolio; try pulling some key dishes and props from your shoots and placing them on some simple, seamless backgrounds. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/136049407/m%3D900/v2?sig=269011b0fb37ab5c3361b82015af0ebbcc2fde2b0269e43a2512accbf0ed3e37\" alt=\"Mug cake by Elisabeth Coelfen on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/136049407/Mug-cake-by-Elisabeth-Coelfen\" alt=\"Mug cake by Elisabeth Coelfen on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>When working with minimalism, limit yourself to a clean color palette, with just two or three hues, to add a bit of “pop” to your compositions. Bold, saturated colors and tranquil, calming tones like Pantone’s “Classic Blue” are both trendy these days. Remember to leave plenty of negative space around and in between your dishes and props so that buyers can add customized copy to your photos. </p>\n<h2>Avoid copyright issues</h2>\n<p>When Licensing your photos commercially, you have to be wary of any trademarked details, like stickers on fruit or logos on crockpots. Watch out for pesky labels and packaging and any sneaky branded details on utensils or kitchen equipment (pots and pans, etc.). These will all have to be excluded from your photos or edited out in post-processing. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/296227797/m%3D900/v2?sig=6a355850428d33da5544c1fc7ee44e4e68807c24f0be01e87a0b41cabc007298\" alt=\"Homemade coffee cupcakes by Natasha Breen on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/296227797/Homemade-coffee-cupcakes-by-Natasha-Breen\" alt=\"Homemade coffee cupcakes by Natasha Breen on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Try new things</h2>\n<p>In recent years, the “flat-lay” composition may have reigned supreme on social media, but there’s so much more to food photography than that familiar top-down perspective. Commercial food photography is getting more creative and less homogenous, so remember to move around and try out different angles. </p>\n<p>Experiment on-set and see what works for the dish at hand. For example, Buddha bowls might be well-suited to the classic flat-lay format, but sandwiches and pancakes will probably look best from the side so you can see all their different layers. In post-processing, play with creative crops and orientations to see what looks good. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/197410999/m%3D900/v2?sig=192b4b4a3d4d6e878870cc25d35c1b0ff562470e08c39c8497f72e5888329eed\" alt=\"Smoothie by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/197410999/Smoothie-by-Raquel-Carmona-Romero\" alt=\"Smoothie by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Keep it timely</h2>\n<p>Commercial photo sales generally run in cycles, as buyers anticipate and plan for seasonal ad campaigns. Make sure you’re prepared and have your holiday-themed food pictures edited and submitted months in advance, when designers first start looking for them. Similarly, remember to incorporate fresh, seasonal foods (e.g., pumpkin for fall, citrus for winter, watermelon for summer, etc.) into your sets for commercial photos with a timely twist. </p>\n<p>At the same time, remember that some foods are timeless, and pictures of these dishes will sell month after month and year after year. By adding “evergreen” photos of popular meals like pasta, salads, sandwiches, and cakes, you’ll ensure your portfolio remains relevant for a long time to come. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?

      "content": "\n<p>In 2020, amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis, brands around the world are facing increased pressure to put social responsibility above profit. Customers are demanding more transparency, honesty, and action from the businesses they support, and as companies look for better ways to connect with and support their communities during this time, we’re witnessing a sea of change in the world of advertising. </p>\n<p>As brands search for photos that not only promote their products but also align with and illustrate their core values, these cultural shifts translate into a new era for commercial images. For a while now, themes relating to health and wellness, diversity and inclusion, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation have been redefining stock photography, and the events of 2020 have put many of these ideas into sharper focus. </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, as part of their <a href=\"https://creativeinsights.gettyimages.com/en/visual-gps\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Visual GPS report</a>, the Creative Insights team at Getty Images drew on 25 years of trend research—and partnered with market research firm YouGov—to determine some of the key “forces” shaping today’s visual culture. These are the defining trends of the new decade, and they’re also terms marketing agencies use often during their image searches. Read on and refer back to them when conceptualizing (and adding metadata to) new shoots for your Licensing portfolio. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/136061399/City-Runner-by-Jozef-Polc\" alt=\"City Runner by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/136061399/m%3D900/v2?sig=9a86098eb909f7cfa8cfd43c0b92484145148b51aa8a5a1b4ef5cb51063ce35b\" alt=\"City Runner by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wellness</h2>\n<p>The wellness force might have traditionally been associated with physical health and fitness, but in recent years, it’s expanded to include themes like mental, spiritual, and emotional wellbeing. Research suggests that 91% of people believe that it’s important to talk about mental health, and 90% try to take care of themselves emotionally, so these are all concepts brands are looking to bring to life through images. </p>\n<p>Commercial photographers can tap into the wellness movement by capturing families practicing mindfulness and meditation, or by highlighting healthy friendships, meaningful relationships, and moments of kindness and joy. Think about ways to visualize a sense of belonging and the celebration of life’s little moments, whether it’s brunch with friends or a yoga class.* </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011768074/Mootherhood-Jorian-and-Soleil-by-Samantha-Pierre\" alt=\"Mootherhood, Jorian and Soleil by Samantha Pierre on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011768074/m%3D900/v2?sig=e4b1cd338cfd2fce84870c521c018bb00efb195df332497399f97809969a0a2a\" alt=\"Mootherhood, Jorian and Soleil by Samantha Pierre on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wellness during the pandemic has also posed new challenges and opportunities; for instance, <a href=\"https://intelligence.wundermanthompson.com/trend-reports/the-future-100-2-0-20/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wunderman Thompson Intelligence</a> named digital spas and one of their trends for the year, citing wellness brands that are offering their services—from meditation sessions to yoga tutorials to homemade therapeutic recipes—online.

Especially during this pandemic, these kinds of commercial images reveal the positive possibilities of connecting through technology. According to a report from <a href=\"https://intelligence.wundermanthompson.com/trend-reports/the-future-100-2-0-20/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wunderman Thompson Intelligence</a>, 88% of people say they have a better appreciation for the role that technology plays in helping society during the coronavirus crisis. </p>\n<p>Ideas for photoshoots include video chats, food delivery, working from home, home-schooling, selfies for social media—the list goes on. They could also extend to include emerging trends like AI and VR. Technology can easily factor into any kind of lifestyle, business, or family photoshoot, even in subtle ways. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1016828589/young-couple-day-in-life-online--by-Jason-Hampden\" alt=\"young couple day in life online  by Jason Hampden on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1016828589/m%3D900/v2?sig=6cc980ee82819b8d488a31108fe8ee06edc0afd006578b61f8ca936d1d8f6983\" alt=\"young couple day in life online  by Jason Hampden on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>It can be aspirational and futuristic (searches for “technology innovation” are up on Getty Images) or accessible and relatable (the search term “humanizing tech” emerged on Getty Images in 2018).

Single-use plastics (straws, bags, cups, bottles, toothbrushes, coffee pods, etc.) are out, and reusable eco-friendly products are in. </p>\n<p>With 92% of people believing how we treat our planet now will have a large impact on our future, 87% saying they are concerned about our oceans, and 85% feeling worried about air pollution, the sustainability force, as defined by Getty Images, is all about connecting with the natural world—and preserving it through the choices we make in our everyday lives. </p>\n<p>As noted by the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/2020-topics-and-trends-report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Topics and Trends Report from Facebook IQ</a>, the movement towards more sustainable lifestyles has led to the emergence of new trends globally, from the rise of beekeeping in Canada to an increased interest in sustainable fashion throughout Sweden and the United Kingdom. </p>\n<p>For commercial photographers, tapping into this force can be as simple as swapping harmful props and products with sustainable ones (80% of people actively try to reduce their plastic use), or showing the small changes we can make to reduce our carbon footprints, like biking to work rather than driving or decluttering our lives and reducing overconsumption. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1014111419/Sustainable-Bottle-by-Marcia-Fernandes\" alt=\"Sustainable Bottle by Marcia Fernandes on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1014111419/m%3D900/v2?sig=a1562a1d7fb056ee316e0c81e6744b42d5f204ca77ff68c7db333faa77b4391f\" alt=\"Sustainable Bottle by Marcia Fernandes on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even a metal straw or bamboo toothbrush here and there, incorporated as part of a larger lifestyle shoot, can signal to customers that a brand is serious about incorporating more sustainable practices. If you’re a travel photographer, use your work to promote sustainable travel, without plastics or air pollution. Connecting with a volunteer cleanup community or local farm can also pose the perfect opportunity for capturing in-demand commercial content. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1014112422/Grocery-Bag-by-Marcia-Fernandes\" alt=\"Grocery Bag by Marcia Fernandes on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1014112422/m%3D900/v2?sig=99bdc5ca593cc61093b3ba5c5e2473354f43810b1d2cb7d2eb7cb31728db27dc\" alt=\"Grocery Bag by Marcia Fernandes on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Think about ways to visualize an ethical, sustainable lifestyle through the use of plant-based foods or beauty products, as searches for <em>veganism</em> are on the rise on Getty Images.

The realness force, like wellness, centers around themes like empathy and acceptance. Customers are fed up with disingenuous marketing; instead, they crave relatable, real-world images featuring people who share their experiences and perspectives. </p>\n<p>This movement emerged in part due to our changing relationship with images in the age of social media; because people can now create their own content, they’re looking for commercial images that make them feel seen and heard. “Brands are now looking to connect to people on their level, not present them with some commercial fairytale,” the 500px Content Team tells us. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1017114186/young-girl-with-flowers-on-the-field-by-Alena-Sadreeva\" alt=\"young girl with flowers on the field by Alena Sadreeva on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1017114186/m%3D900/v2?sig=9b97fe1310513c82cfa35eb21613efb368b6618b607da92a9f3de1668a98d3c3\" alt=\"young girl with flowers on the field by Alena Sadreeva on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>With 80% of people saying companies need to show people with all body types and shapes, many brands are moving away from over-edited, retouched, and manipulated images. Instead, marketers today strive to be honest and transparent, and that means representing their customers and their communities in a way that feels truthful and genuine. </p>\n<p>On Getty Images, the search term <em>unretouched</em> was the fastest growing in 2019, and the Creative Insights team named <a href=\"https://creativeinsights.gettyimages.com/en/trends/realness/acne-positivity\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">skin positivity</a> as one of their emerging trends. Realness also extends beyond appearance to include genuine emotions and connections between people; it means embracing individuality and self-expression over the pressure to conform. In many cases, professional models might be replaced by family members and friends. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011725634/a-happy-senior-woman-smiling-Russia-Raisa-Agafonova-by-Aks-Huckleberry\" alt=\"a happy senior woman smiling, Russia, Raisa Agafonova by Aks Huckleberry on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011725634/m%3D900/v2?sig=c3da8464421cd94c37dd3c800886c2a7c6cf06a24ff404c48c4e3d1b069e5b20\" alt=\"a happy senior woman smiling, Russia, Raisa Agafonova by Aks Huckleberry on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Inclusivity</h2>\n<p>With 57% of people saying they’ve personally been affected by bias, the realness force goes hand-in-hand with a growing movement promoting inclusivity in advertising, as people who are passionate about realness are also likely to work toward equality and against discrimination. </p>\n<p>More than two-thirds (68%) of customers across generations say it’s important to them to buy from companies that celebrate diversity of all kinds, and that number increases to 76% among Millennials and Gen Zers. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011740712/Young-Confident-Woman-at-the-Library-in-US-Afrah-Yafai--by-Dahyembi-Joi\" alt=\"Young Confident Woman at the Library, in US, Afrah Yafai  by Dahyembi Joi on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011740712/m%3D900/v2?sig=78767179a0a33a0ec6142e78a68029c22faacda7acb2ccdef466edbc0f2f4743\" alt=\"Young Confident Woman at the Library, in US, Afrah Yafai  by Dahyembi Joi on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>For photographers, that means making a continuous and conscious commitment to highlighting, celebrating, and collaborating with people of all ages, gender identities, races, nationalities, sexual orientations, abilities, body shapes, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, and more—and representing them truthfully and authentically. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1008712540/Beautiful-Baby-Blue-by-Comet-West\" alt=\"Beautiful Baby Blue by Comet West on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1008712540/m%3D900/v2?sig=8cae95b13f5afd26b48efea151535d1baf0c5c23e1dc6fcc4feb050e29b70afb\" alt=\"Beautiful Baby Blue by Comet West on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>With 33% of people having boycotted a brand that went against their values and 34% having started purchasing a brand that supported a cause they believed in, this movement is about action, not empty promises.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like all modern love stories, I found macro photography on the internet. I hadn’t long bought my first camera when I was stunned by the intricacy of insects when observed close up. I hurriedly punched in ‘Amazon’ and began searching for the lenses I’d seen in the EXIF data of the photos I admired and quickly sank in to a penniless depression. However, I picked my peasant self up off the floor, dusted myself down and decided to find a cheaper alternative to see if macro photography was ‘for me’. I found one and it was. </p>\n<p>From then on my love for macro photography grew and so did my arsenal of equipment. In the years I’ve been a serial bug-botherer and crouching garden lurker I have learnt a lot and gradually compiled a document of information with the view to someday write a guide. What started out as a curiosity and a £7 ($10) macro filter quickly turned in to an interest and I have spent an unthinkably large number of hours honing my craft. Now, macro (albeit product) photography is one of my chief sources of income and I feel that I am in a position to offer some of my knowledge. There will always be more talented, creative, learned and passionate macro photographers than me but I’ll share what I know and answer any questions in the comments. </p>\n<p>Although this guide is comprehensive, I’m purposely leaving out detailed explanations of magnification and similar such in-depth-camera-nerdery but I implore you to read up on it at some stage. </p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h2>The Gear</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Macro/Close-up Filters</h3>\n<p>These filters are the unsung heroes of macro photography. I’d go as far as to say that in no other genre of photography can you dip your toe in the pool so inexpensively. </p>\n<p>The following shots were taken by me when I was ‘dipping my toe’. I had little to no idea about lighting macro shots, I had little to no idea about editing images and I was armed with only a Canon 550D, the 18-55mm kit lens it came with and a very cheap macro filter. All these years later I <i>still</i> like these images (particularly the successful spider) and I am confident that much, much more can be achieved with the same completely unspecialised and attainable set up.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/8571747/m%3D900/v2?sig=3a9f4cdcc9150f6d4636b9981ab7778fc01495968c8d6d369dd6eef7cabb7cd1\" alt=\"macro-photography - Not Evil by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, the image quality is low but that was more to do with my inexperience in post-processing as opposed to a result of the filter. If you think you may enjoy macro photography, this ought to be your first step.</p>\n<h3>Reverse Rings</h3>\n<p>I arrived late to the reverse ring party. I had heard about them, I had even seen great results, I just couldn’t figure out when and why I would use them over my macro lens and extension tubes. Nevertheless, my curiosity got the better of me and as they are also rather cheap, I gave them a go. </p>\n<p>There is a lot of literature available on using reverse rings and as I’m somewhat inexperienced with them, so I will keep this section short and include only observations I made first-hand.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/91793429/m%3D900/v2?sig=e44158b16cd68bb97d4fa148c0789978be00192519a661b70e4b4bdb6c7c847a\" alt=\"macro-photography - The Dweller by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The above image was actually a result of my curiosity running away with me; it’s a reversed 100mm lens AND extension tubes (which are explained at the end of this section). Here’s what I learned:</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> The magnification is incredibly impressive.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> You have to get so close to your subject that the glass is nearly touching it.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> Lighting is quite tricky and damn near impossible with 3 extension tubes added. I had to use multiple bright lights situated very close to the subject and bump ISO to 1250 and widen the aperture a little. Flashes were rendered useless as they all lit <i>past</i> the subject.</p>\n<p>How this tiny jumping spider had the patience to sit still on my laptop (yes, that’s what the surface is) while I did all this is a mystery to me. I hear reversing a 50mm is much more usable out-and-about and this is another toe-dipper I would recommend to those of you with a passing interest.</p>\n<h3>Macro Lenses</h3>\n<p>If you’ve decided that you want to explore the wonderful world of photographing tiny things you previously didn’t care for, then a macro lens can open up a lot more opportunities.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/100442449/m%3D900/v2?sig=5f16c7ddeddd0e83a562a4d250d2cbe05576026c6ed6de98ad3cb4b895e865eb\" alt=\"macro-photography - Edge of today by Roni Hendrawan on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/100442449/Edge-of-today-by-Roni-Hendrawan\" alt=\"macro-photography - Edge of today by Roni Hendrawan on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, a caveat I ought to add is that I shoot Canon and so my advice on Nikon (and other DSLR manufacturers) is simply the average of all the opinions I could find rather than mine. There are far too many lens review sites that go in to exceptional depth for me to need to do the same, so I will give a simple overview of your best options.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/117104661/m%3D900/v2?sig=d2bf9d61c21ce24784ccc762f561fae2ff7cff5af166ec563ff995f802383f2e\" alt=\"macro-photography - Jumping Spider white by Robert K.

Although they are macro lenses, they can be used for other types of photography and their usual focal length is particularly pleasing for portraiture. The best options:</p>\n<p><i><u>Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro</u></i>: This is the lens I have used for 99% of my macro work and I cannot recommend it enough. Like a lot of macro lenses, its autofocus at the macro level is hit and miss but that isn’t the biggest of problems.

This lens is for macro and macro only. It is infamously tricky to use at first and will require practice before you start tapping in to its potential; however, its potential runs very deep indeed. </p>\n<p>I would refer you again to <a href=\"http://www.edphillipswildlife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ed’s website</a> to see just how incredible the results can be. You can photograph mites of only a millimeter and see unparalleled detail. It is around the same price as the Canon 100mm f/2.8 L but with far more limited applications. </p>\n<p>Due to its high magnification it is usually paired with a very high end macro flash—the MT-24—which you can learn more about in the lighting section. Below is an example of the more extreme end of its potential.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/35273098/m%3D900/20c467064d422bb2f650f3b94381a9bf\" alt=\"macro-photography - Pseudoscorpion (False Scorpion) by Ed Phillips on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/35273098/pseudoscorpion-false-scorpion-by-ed-phillips\" alt=\"macro-photography - Pseudoscorpion (False Scorpion) by Ed Phillips on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Extension Tubes</h3>\n<p>Extension tubes are surprisingly simple things. Unlike their teleconverter cousins with whom they can be confused, they have no optical element; that is, there’s no glass in them. In fact, there’s very little to them altogether. </p>\n<p>The aim of the game for extension tubes is to reduce the minimum focusing distance so that you can get closer to your subject and a higher magnification. This is especially useful when you’re working with the tiniest of insects.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/91793203/m%3D900/v2?sig=2e8960e354a6dfabec439b8c2e29bbabf75c9212c1809e485f62d5d7bad06daf\" alt=\"macro-photography - A Closer Look by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Extension tubes tend to come in threes; 36mm, 20mm and 12mm. They can be stacked for the maximum effect. They are relatively inexpensive and have a drastic impact on your minimum focusing distance although it’s worth noting that substantially more light is needed to correctly expose a shot, particularly with all 3 stacked.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h2>The Lighting</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lighting is to a macro photographer what ingredients are to a chef; the better the ingredients, the better the results. However, this can send you down a rabbit hole which ends in empty wallets and results that could have been achieved (at least for the most part) without remortgaging and selling private images of your better half. </p>\n<p>I will cycle through lighting setups I have tried and tested in financial brackets and I will ward you away from mistakes I have made.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/23211057/m%3D900/v2?sig=f5a9f2c56784d946fedb6ca271a50b08354cec63380c65e57808cec5fd48fe55\" alt=\"macro-photography - Life in Colour by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Free: Natural Light</h3>\n<p>It’s not impossible to shoot macro with natural light, and if someone tells you it is, they’re lying… or at least, sort of. The above shot was taken using only natural light, but there are limitations. </p>\n<p>Firstly, you need a bright day. Those overcast days that populate 75% of my year here in England just won’t cut it. You will have to boost the ISO too high, lower the aperture too low, or lose the insect in the frame. </p>\n<p>With bright sunlight you can get reasonably close and still expose the image correctly; however, you’re at the behest of the insect and the weather. Should your subject decide it doesn’t have high enough SPF sun cream on to tolerate this UV exposure and relocates to a shady leaf, you’re almost certainly out of luck.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/65935797/m%3D900/v2?sig=31145ea4ad52d587acfb46b278c1455ca149c9ce92a2211db58487138929fc4f\" alt=\"macro-photography - A Hoverfly and Friends by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Nearly Free: Reflectors</h3>\n<p>As above, this is certainly possible… but again, not ideal. You still need a bright day, but you can fill any shadows, you can brighten your subject, and you can adjust to some re-locations. </p>\n<p>The overarching problem I found with reflectors is you need an assistant or several more arms to make everything work. With macro photography, I move a lot. It becomes very awkward to juggle the reflector, my camera, and my position without wobbling the camera as I shoot, falling over, or scaring the insect away with a big white impending disc. Of course, smaller reflectors, remote releases, and tripods can overcome a lot of these difficulties but mobility is far too important to me and all of those sacrifice it. </p>\n<p>The shot at the top of this section was taken during very bright sunlight and using a 48cm white reflector that was bouncing direct sunlight straight on to the hoverfly. I only needed to push the ISO to 320 to get to my preferred shutter speed of 1/200th.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/188266969/m%3D900/v2?sig=dd62898c46a09ab447c749cfc06291d301efd0838f41e8a2e2168c13c72f0c59\" alt=\"macro-photography - This is My Flower... by Juliana Nan on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/188266969/This-is-My-Flower-by-Juliana-Nan\" alt=\"This is My Flower... by Juliana Nan on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Entry Level Flashes</h3>\n<p>It is here I made my first real mistake. I had read how incredible ring flashes were for macro photography. This is primarily due to them being fixed on to the front of the lens and always lighting your subject. This much is without question true. </p>\n<p>However, I didn’t want to give £500 ($720) or more to Canon and decided to see if any Chinese eBay shops could sort me out with something a little less financially imposing. </p>\n<p>After 20 days my rather suspect looking package arrived and I set it all up. It looked the real deal but I quickly learnt its sync speeds were far too slow to be useful. In its place I bought the Marumi Ring Flash.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/9516611/m%3D900/v2?sig=dce1debbd3af4899e48bf284ae9cb3ed3ecba2b16d8696c507a3e07c19455b8f\" alt=\"Hypnotised by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are available around the £100 ($145) mark, though I implore you to do some research as I have it on good authority that you can get a near identical unit for closer to £80 ($115). </p>\n<p>They really are a great first choice for getting sharp and well-lit shots. That said, given the proximity of the ring flash to the subject, you need to be sensitive to how harsh the light can be. Here’s an example of me slightly misjudging that:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stock-Wasp.jpg\" alt=\"Stock Wasp\" width=\"1750\" height=\"1162\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30957\" srcset=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stock-Wasp.jpg 1750w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stock-Wasp-500x332.jpg 500w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stock-Wasp-768x510.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px\"></p>\n<p>Another method which I see overlooked very often is ordinary flash guns. I’ve had some success with my Canon 430EX II on my camera’s hotshot with a small portable soft box over the top of it. The only problem you can run into is that, if you get very close to the subject, the lens can block a lot of the flash’s light.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/8618455/m%3D900/v2?sig=8a6dbbd6914ee16fe6d9cc34a25d731862ab18f5eb99533b0f32913349f2324d\" alt=\"So Fresh, So clean by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3>High End Flashes</h3>\n<p>The top end flash guns for macro tend to follow the same format: two flash units situated on either side of the lens. This gives you a lot more control over your lighting and it’s widely regarded as the best choice, particularly if you’re using a specialised macro lens like the MP-E 65mm. </p>\n<p>The two most common examples are Canon’s Twin Lite MT-24 EX and Nikon’s Speedlight Remote Kit R1. Both will set you back around £400-500 ($550-700).</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Begging.jpg\" alt=\"Begging\" width=\"1750\" height=\"1310\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30959\" srcset=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Begging.jpg 1750w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Begging-500x374.jpg 500w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Begging-768x575.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px\"></p>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p>This is the section I most wanted to write. The industry of lighting in photography baffles me. I was chatting with an electrician friend of mine recently and we worked out that we could create a light I wanted for portrait work for around £60 ($85) and a company I won’t name, slapped a fancy label on it and wanted ten times that price. Light behaves exactly the same regardless of what context its source is designed for.</p>\n<p>The example image above this section was taken without a single flash gun in almost pitch black conditions. Instead, I used 3 snap-on LED Hybrid Lights which are, in essence, small banks of LED bulbs (around the size of a large torch). They give a nice crisp white light as a permanent light source. </p>\n<p>I used one at 45 degrees to the left of my camera close to the subject. I used a second 45 degrees to the right of my camera as a fill light, twice as far away as the left light source. I then used a final snap-on at 90 degrees to the subject as a second fill light to eliminate harsh shadows and give a more even feel. </p>\n<p>Yes, I respect that this setup is far too cumbersome to be your go-to lighting, but the salient point is this: if you can’t afford the best flash guns, there are <i>always</i> alternatives and hand held LED torches with multiple small bulbs are very effective.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h2>The Settings</h2>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/117104269/m%3D900/v2?sig=9ac6f64bf9d999948d4355c522f46757709cf031dcbe3ccd26d39b0886becbff\" alt=\"Mite by Robert K.

With macro photography, knowing which settings you need without trial and error can be the difference between a portfolio-worthy shot and a useless fuzzy blob (and no, you can’t call it abstract art simply because you missed!).</p>\n<p>In most cases, the fastest sync speed to flash guns is 1/200th and as insects move at almost imperceptible speeds, you want your shutter speed as fast as possible. So, in the exposure triangle, you usually have the most control over flash gun power, ISO, and aperture.</p>\n<p><b>Aperture</b>: This is a bit of a curve ball in macro photography. You might think that with the focal plane being so narrow, the narrower the aperture the better, but that’s not strictly true. </p>\n<p>With macro lenses, you are so close to your subject that the difference between f/7.1 and f/13 will often be almost undetectable. As a result, I tend to use my lenses’ sweet spots for the sharpest results which are around f/11. </p>\n<p>I won’t go in to what the ‘sweet spot’ is, but if you’re not sure there are numerous articles and videos out there explaining it.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/191422551/m%3D900/v2?sig=0e0c0333f810ac1265e27a37b32d03d833cccdeb2df52d5f740420ff43fd1579\" alt=\"~~``~~ by Juliana Nan on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/191422551/-by-Juliana-Nan\" alt=\"~~``~~ by Juliana Nan on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>ISO</b>: Your approach to ISO ought to be similar to how it is with any photography: the lower the better, generally speaking. That said, I will make one observation. I have found that high ISO is punished more in macro photography than in some other areas. </p>\n<p>With astrophotography, for example, ISO of even 3200 or 6400 is not only necessary at times, but will not impact the final image all that much. With macro photography, however, the focus on detail is huge and with the greater attention to image quality comes the decreased value in high ISOs. </p>\n<p>Get to know what your camera can handle in terms of ISO without the image becoming noisy, grainy and soft.</p>\n<p><b>Flash gun power</b>: There is very little to say on this subject, fortunately. It is merely a case of working out which output correctly exposes your subject. </p>\n<p>All I would in say in way of a tip is that a lot of insects (and many other macro subjects actually) have shiny or reflective surfaces. So be careful not to overexpose some areas and lose precious detail and texture. </p>\n<p>It is also worth repeating my earlier advice here: small soft boxes or diffusers really help to cut out the harsh light of macro photography.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/91793263/m%3D900/v2?sig=e42d645826eafa3646632db9809c96b79fb76ec96332af18a95364f637546580\" alt=\"Jeffrey by Robert K.

The first time I said it was for about ten minutes before the shot of the spider surrounded by flies taken with a Canon 550D, kit lens and macro filter. </p>\n<p>I had plodded around the garden for 15 minutes, staring at plants like a crazed botanist. I couldn’t even find so much as the staple macro subject of a Bluebottle. I then defiantly muttered to myself the non-sequitur above and, lo and behold, I discovered the rather successful spider. From that day on, whenever I couldn’t find anything to photography, I’d repeat that saying and keep looking.</p>\n<p>What I would suggest initially is learning an area; be that your garden, a local lake or pond, or even just a large local bush (stop sniggering). Insects are habitual creatures like anything else—as I will come on to shortly—and they are attracted to certain things and repelled by others. It pays to know where interesting insects dwell.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/117104697/m%3D900/v2?sig=25bc534b9dc8f5e42a6aff1a9f944938036475af0058f20b6c1b333b2ae692f8\" alt=\"Red Spider by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Shoot on an out-breath.</b> This tip can serve you well across a lot of photography, and it was given to me by a marksman.</p>\n<p>When I first started macro photograph I used to hold my breath while edging in to that beautiful slither of focus. I would miss myriad shots and I blamed the shutter button shake, but that wasn’t it. My marksman friend told me that when you shoot, you pull the trigger at the end of a breath and don’t hold your breath to pull the trigger as that can cause you to wobble. Heed this advice! Shooting a rifle and macro shooting an insect with a camera have remarkable overlap; both require a very steady hand and accuracy that is measured in millimeters. </p>\n<p>A secondary tip along the same plane of thought is to use a monopod where possible. I found this awkward but there are incredibly talented macro photographers who swear by them.</p>\n<p><b>If the insects won’t come to you, go to the insects.</b> I live in England and our wildlife is largely uninteresting; this extends to insects. </p>\n<p>One option I fully recommend is visiting butterfly or insect houses. There are plenty and I have never had any of their employees unhappy about me and my giant camera following the insects about. In fact, it’s usually quite the opposite. </p>\n<p>In the below image, which was taken with natural light in a butterfly house, one of the ladies who worked there followed me around telling me about all the different types of butterflies and their behaviors.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/117104233/m%3D900/v2?sig=0050ae81709c583dac2e4d83570bc3fcd53208eebaedd7a6d3daf43f06992f8d\" alt=\"Emporor Butterfly by Robert K.

Baggs on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Shoot at the beginning and end of the day.</b> This tip seems a little counter-intuitive, particularly when the reason is explained: the temperatures are cooler and so the bugs are less active.</p>\n<p>This is advice I had forgotten until Ed reminded me, but it is very useful to know. In the early morning and in the early evening you will find that insects are a lot more tolerant of you and less inclined to move around allowing you to edge towards that perfect shot. And speaking of edging towards your subject…</p>\n<p><b>Move slowly around your subject</b>! This is obvious, I know, but it’s easy to forget. You’ll be as calm as a Hindu cow until some rare insect lands near you and then form and light-footedness goes out the window. </p>\n<p>Always approach your subject very softly and edge in to focal range. Avoid sudden movements and as Ed again reminded me:</p>\n<p><b>Don’t let your shadow pass over the subject.</b> Be aware of where the sun is and don’t cause an eclipse on your subject. Firstly, it’ll throw off your lighting settings but, more importantly, most insects are attuned to shadows being predators and darting off in to the undergrowth when the sun is blotted out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bee-Looking-at-Me.jpg\" alt=\"macro-photography - Bee Looking at Me\" width=\"1750\" height=\"1750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30964\" srcset=\"https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bee-Looking-at-Me.jpg 1750w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bee-Looking-at-Me-500x500.jpg 500w, https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bee-Looking-at-Me-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px\"></p>\n<p><b>Insects are habitual like any conscious creature.</b> They will often frequent the same plants and areas, they will act differently in different temperatures, and they like what they like.</p>\n<p>What do I mean by this? Insects are often where they are because they want to be there not that they happen to be there. As Ed qualifies: ‘if you frighten something away, it’s sometimes worth waiting, camera ready, to see if it returns.’ </p>\n<p>I can’t offer a better example than the below images. They were taken a year apart to nearly the day (16th April 2014 and 14th April 2015) and were both taken in the same 2 meter squared area of lawn near some roses. That’s how habitual insects can be. Plus, these two shots bring me on to the most important tip.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/67297553/m%3D900/v2?sig=a90f323801d079d82cc9e4d2b30d15f0849bfc74ce5aab712d51d28c05f66896\" alt=\"macro-photography - Beefly (Bombyliidae) in Flight by Robert K.

The headshot of the Damselfly earlier in this guide took me months of going back to the same lake where I had seen several of them. Then, on the day I got the shot, I followed the same Damselfly for nearly an hour until it fully settled. However, the two images above of the Beeflies in flight take the biscuit.</p>\n<p>The first shot took over 2 hours and over 1000 missed shots to get. The area this Beefly was in is overlooked by at least 5 houses and there’s zero chance that the occupants can see a Beefly (marginally bigger than a Bluebottle) from whichever vantage point they are at.</p>\n<p>Instead, they see a twenty-something man, in shorts and shirtless, with a massive camera and flash guns, crouched and waddling around a small patch of lawn for hours, stopping occasionally to fire flashes at, for all intents and purposes, nothing.</p>\n<p>The next year the shot took under 2 hours and around 400 missed shots. Capturing a fly (it is actually a fly, not a bee) in flight requires monk-like patience but all the most unique shots do.

It allows you to capture moments that would be lost to the human eye or indexed in a vast library of dusty memories never to be looked at again. </p>\n<p>For the astrophotographer, galaxies unavailable to the naked eye are unlocked; for the portrait photographer, micro expressions are frozen in time for all to enjoy; for macro photographers, the layers of detail that we overlook with a near criminal lack of due care and attention bubbles to the surface and can be transferred to sizes great enough to strike awe in to all those who cast eyes on it.</p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugs cool</li>\n<li>Photography expensive</li>\n<li>Macro filter/reverse rings cheap</li>\n<li>Lenses justifiable to angry spouse</li>\n<li>Stop paying silly money for lights</li>\n<li>Don’t go home; look harder</li>\n<li>Be patient</li>\n<li>Look insane to neighbours</li>\n<li>Profit</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This article was original published in 2016.</em></p>\n<p><b>You Might Also Like These Articles:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/incredible-macro-photos-taken-with-a-smartphone-diy-lens/\"><u>Incredible Macro Photos Taken With A smartphone &amp; DIY Lens</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/macro-photography-4-tutorials-full-tips-tricks/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Macro Photography: 4 Tutorials Full of Tips &amp; Tricks</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/35-mobile-photography-tips-thatll-help-you-take-incredible-smartphone-shots/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>35 Mobile Photography Tips For Taking Better Smartphone Shots</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/tutorial-how-to-process-macro-photos/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Tutorial: How to Process Macro Photos</u></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/the-ultimate-guide-for-macro-photography-beginners/\">The Ultimate Guide for Macro Photography Beginners</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Psychological <a href=\"http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201630762633846.page\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> suggests that, in general, we pay more attention and are more likely to understand artworks that have explanatory titles, as opposed to artworks that are left untitled. While many artists leave titling to the last minute, these studies reveal that titles can be an important factor in determining an audience’s response to a work of art. </p>\n<p>Perhaps something similar can be said for commercial stock photography; image titles are often the first thing buyers see, and they can make or break a sale. Plus, because image-buyers tend to use keywords to source photos, an untitled photo will inevitably get lost in the shuffle, while an expertly titled one will rise to the top. </p>\n<p>On many platforms, including 500px and Getty Images, your title also becomes part of your image URL, meaning that it’s searchable through Google and other engines. The better your title, the more eyes you get on your photos. </p>\n<p>The right approach to image titling is imperative, as it can significantly boost the discoverability of your Licensing portfolio, but still, many photographers overlook this part of the metadata process. Below, you’ll find our top tips for crafting the perfect stock photography titles and maximizing your sales potential—now and in the future. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/180044903/Typer-is-writing-by-Konstantin-Kolosov\" alt=\"Typer is writing by Konstantin Kolosov on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/180044903/m%3D900/v2?sig=86e5aba618aba122797ce20e092feb29f5a0628440104918ed9003273b6d26ed\" alt=\"Typer is writing by Konstantin Kolosov on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Stay literal</h2>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes in Licensing is choosing a title that’s so abstract that it doesn’t accurately describe the photo. “When you title your commercial content in abstract terms or phrases, you’re severely limiting its opportunity of showing up in relevant searches,” the 500px Content Team tells us. </p>\n<p>The problem with titling your photo with, say, a song lyric or a line from a poem is that, while it might sound great, it won’t show up in relevant buyer searches. Instead, just stick with the basics: tell us who’s in the photo, how many people are in the photo, how old they are, what their gender identities and ethnicities are, what they’re doing, and where they’re doing it. Think like a buyer, rather than an artist. </p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"http://100photos.time.com/photos/nasa-pillars-of-creation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Pillars of Creation</em></a> as an example. It’s a beautiful title for NASA’s iconic 1995 shot of the Serpens constellation, but it would make for a poor stock photo title because it doesn’t tell you what’s in the photo. Instead, if you planned to license this picture, you’d go with something more literal like ‘The Eagle Nebula in the constellation Serpens Cauda, captured by The Hubble Space Telescope.’ </p>\n<p>Your title should read like a caption in a news story: you need to convey factual information, without too much interpretation or creative license. As with a news headline, you should also keep it short and simple, without packing in too much information. If it’s too long, it’ll get cut off in the URL. Five to seven words should do the trick. </p>\n<h2>Add an abstract twist</h2>\n<p>Staying literal doesn’t mean you can’t add one or two conceptual keywords into your titles; it just means using them lightly. You can always include words relating to the emotion or mood behind your photo, as these are terms buyers are likely to search. “Descriptive words like <em>strong, accomplished, connecting with</em>, etc. are all great ways to get creative with your titles while optimizing them for relevant searches,” the Content Team explains. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/304707293/Rajesh-by-Brianna--R\" alt=\"Rajesh by Brianna  R on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/304707293/m%3D900/v2?sig=b33af34a30e2a7bf403b985cdab52b7749bf08cc59b85b4d780960f6f4ba8d82\" alt=\"Rajesh by Brianna  R on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here’s an example from the 500px collection on Getty Images, where this photo bears the title ‘Young man with moustache and bib overalls daydreaming.’ <em>Daydreaming</em> is an abstract idea, but it’s one many buyers might add to that search bar. It’s also relevant and descriptive, helping that picture stand out among all the other photos of young men in the collection. </p>\n<p>The trick here is to limit yourself to just one or a couple of abstract words or phrases, as a supplement to an otherwise literal title. If it adds to the overall meaning and message of your photo, include it. If it confuses the meaning or makes it hard to understand, leave it out. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/121593027/Catch-a-moment-by-Andrey-Sh\" alt=\"Catch a moment by Andrey Sh on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/121593027/m%3D900/v2?sig=f6a6b9a3fbe83b591e465b2c929eda0f4deeb3785aae873e378222d5c835194d\" alt=\"Catch a moment by Andrey Sh on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tap into trends (and include props)</h2>\n<p>Buyers often use trending keywords to search for images, so including them in your titles is a great way to boost your visibility. We talk a lot about incorporating timely and relevant props into your photos—like <em>reusable mugs</em> and <em>eco bottles</em> to promote <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sustainability-in-commercial-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sustainability</a>, or <em>mobile devices</em> to represent the role of <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/how-to-shoot-technology-for-licensing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">technology</a> in our everyday lives—and those are terms you should include in your titles as well. </p>\n<p>Even subtle props can work their way into your titles, if they’re relevant. If you’re creating lifestyle content right now, and your model is wearing a <em>face mask</em>, for instance, that’s also something to have in your title as a heads-up to potential buyers. “Especially when a prop represents a broader concept and popular commercial trend, you can and should work it into the title of your commercial photos,” the Content Team advises. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019794973/Young-woman-with-face-mask-working-indoors-in-cafe-disinfecting-by-Jozef-Polc\" alt=\"Young woman with face mask working indoors in cafe, disinfecting by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019794973/m%3D900/v2?sig=b5e236dadbfbfc14d299110e46d6f4fc4ffa593fa48598a8c8b7236dbebb7e95\" alt=\"Young woman with face mask working indoors in cafe, disinfecting by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Include your location</h2>\n<p>You might have heard a few stock photo horror stories surrounding location mix-ups; in 2015, for instance, a Presidential candidate used stock footage shot in England to represent the American landscape, while just last year, another candidate used a photo created in Kenya to represent American citizens. In the latter case, the campaign even commented on the mishap, explaining that the stock website where they sourced the image hadn’t indicated where the photo had been taken. </p>\n<p>Of course, these are extreme examples, but buyers are cautious about sourcing images that are authentic to their audience and customers. They also want images that their customers can relate to—photos that feel personal rather than generic. If they can find a photo taken in their hometown or local neighborhood, their materials are more likely to resonate with their target audience. </p>\n<p>Locations are often the first thing buyers search for when using stock photography, and even when it’s a secondary concern, they want that information to be clear and readily available. For that reason, it’s good practice to include those details in your titles. Get into the habit of putting them at the end of every title, and follow a consistent format (for example: town or city, state or province, and country).</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/311751203/Poppies-by-Richard-Ryan\" alt=\"Poppies by Richard Ryan on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/311751203/m%3D900/v2?sig=a3473bde2c6686ec2b2045847dfc74ff212d776deaaa96f03121a1c9a8298287\" alt=\"Poppies by Richard Ryan on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Getty Images, for example, the photo above is titled ‘Poppy (Papaver rhoeas) field at sunset, Laceby, England, UK’. That means it’ll show up when buyers search for generic poppy field photos, but it’ll also show up when buyers (say, a local tourism board or hotel) search for images of that particular place. If a marketing team wants to represent the landscape or spirit of the UK, they might also look for an image like this one, so adding the location ensures maximum visibility. </p>\n<h2>Remember to spell-check</h2>\n<p>“One of the most common errors we see with titling is one of the easiest to fix,” the Content Team tells us. They’re talking about spelling mistakes, which crop up more often than you might expect in commercial photography. </p>\n<p>If you’re uncertain of any spellings, look them up online, and then go over them with a fine-toothed comb to check for typos before submitting. Be consistent in terms of British or American English spelling variations, and pay special attention to locations. </p>\n<p>“With locations, it is important to ensure you’re using the English version of a country or province’s name, as when photos are sold through distributors like Getty Images, they are presented in English,” the Content Team explains. “If you’re ever unsure of what the appropriate, accepted spelling of a location or country is, you can always search Getty Images for content from the same location. When in doubt, follow what has already been listed on their site.” </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/86981017/Laptop-with-digital-camera-and-a-coffee-cup-by-Benjamin-King\" alt=\"Laptop with digital camera and a coffee cup. by Benjamin King on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/86981017/m%3D900/v2?sig=c5e9a116bb7b536e733172da8acef173663e6a667fe102dd40760c0557db6fd2\" alt=\"Laptop with digital camera and a coffee cup. by Benjamin King on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>These five tips—staying literal, adding a touch of emotion, including props and locations, and checking your spelling—are easy steps to incorporate into your Licensing workflow, but they’re also highly effective. Get into the practice of titling your photos on a consistent basis, following a consistent workflow. From there, track your sales to see what works and finesse as you see fit. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?

Macrostock, or traditional stock photography, tends to be more expensive because it’s exclusive; that is, buyers pay more for the sole right to use the photos. Midstock prices fall somewhere in the middle, and microstock is relatively inexpensive. </p>\n<p>Because microstock isn’t as exclusive, microstock photographers can sell the same images over and over again. In other words, the payments are lower, but they can add up over time. Non-exclusive, royalty-free stock photos are popular among buyers because they’re quick and affordable. The client can use the image multiple times, and copyright remains with the photographer. </p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"https://500px.com/almost-everything-youve-ever-wanted-know-licensing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Almost) everything you’ve ever wanted to know about Licensing</a></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/272057061/hold-me-down-by-Amanda-Carlson\" alt=\"hold me down by Amanda Carlson on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/272057061/m%3D900/v2?sig=fe267fcfac217e2d7e90b9ea396c9d43fe1e8d9e98b3c10fbed3fce860628e29\" alt=\"hold me down by Amanda Carlson on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What are the different types of stock photography?</h2>\n<p>Stock photography usually falls into one of two categories: commercial or editorial. As its name suggests, commercial or “creative” photography can be licensed for use in advertising campaigns, marketing materials, or the promotion of a product or service. </p>\n<p>Editorial photography, on the other hand, cannot be used to sell a product or promote a business. It can be used by newspapers and media outlets for educational or journalistic purposes. Publications like <em>The Guardian</em> or <em>The New York Times</em> regularly use editorial stock photographs to illustrate breaking news and other timely events. </p>\n<p>For this piece, we will focus primarily on commercial/creative stock photography because it tends to have a larger market and the potential for more sales. Because it can be used to sell or advertise, this kind of stock photography also comes with some added requirements, mostly in the form of model and property releases. </p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/understanding-the-differences-between-commercial-editorial-photography/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding the differences between commercial &amp; editorial photography</a></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1007362784/Shadow-and-light-by-Adriana-Samanez\" alt=\"Shadow and light by Adriana Samanez on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1007362784/m%3D900/v2?sig=50544f37167bb0b1123fbb994f7e9d089475da0044cc96b74531e03119770228\" alt=\"Shadow and light by Adriana Samanez on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What are model and property releases, and why do they matter?</h2>\n<p>Releases are contractual documents that protect the photographer, the agency, and the buyer from any potential issues down the road. By signing a model or property release, the people in your photos (or the owners of the property in your photos), give their consent for their likeness to be used commercially down the line. </p>\n<p>Without them, any pictures of recognizable people and property (<a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/unexpected-images-that-require-a-property-release/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">even some surprising cases</a>) can’t be sold as creative stock photography. Keep in mind that property includes intellectual property, such as works of art and branded details and logos, which might be impossible to get released and are therefore best avoided. </p>\n<p>500px has model releases and property releases you can print, and popular apps like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/releases-model-and-property-release-app-by-snapwire/id968090910\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Releases</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-release-model-releases/id360835268\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Release</a> make it easy to get them signed on-the-go using just a phone or tablet. </p>\n<p><strong>Also read</strong>: <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/13-things-might-not-realize-model-property-releases/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">13 things you might not know about model and property releases</a></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011744470/Young-woman-Applying-Makeup-in-mirror-Delator-Dela-Hini-by-Hagar-Wirba\" alt='Young woman Applying Make-up in mirror, Delator \"Dela\" Hini by Hagar Wirba on 500px.com'><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011744470/m%3D900/v2?sig=6f5b0ea0da9be9c17a01cc271115b65eea4b6afeced4f88bfbd9214abfde1e4e\" alt='Young woman Applying Make-up in mirror, Delator \"Dela\" Hini by Hagar Wirba on 500px.com'><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How can you sell your photography on 500px?</h2>\n<p>500px works with two of the biggest names in the business—Getty Images and VCG (Visual China Group)—to distribute and license its photos.

Props and clothing can be found at second-hand stores and in models’ personal collections. A digital asset management tool like Adobe Lightroom can also be a game-changer when editing and organizing hundreds of photos for submission. </p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/shoot-best-stock-photos-licensing-budget/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How to shoot the best stock photos for Licensing on a budget</a></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/308538575/Dandelion-by-Sergey-Vinogradov\" alt=\"Dandelion by Sergey Vinogradov on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/308538575/m%3D900/v2?sig=ca7aa464d5f81f7fa13874e955c0eabbdcbc0e92b73ae33c47839a54714efa2b\" alt=\"Dandelion by Sergey Vinogradov on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How can I make my photos more visible to buyers?</h2>\n<p>Once your photos are accepted for Licensing, they’ll become available to hundreds of thousands of potential buyers; Getty Images alone has more than a million customers.

Make sure your idea and concept are clear and relevant to brands who are looking for creative, aspirational photos for their campaigns. </p>\n<p>In terms of composition, good stock photos tend to be <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/maximizing-crop-for-commercial-appeal/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">croppable</a>, with plenty of copy space for buyers to add text or logos. They’re usually simple and straightforward. They have clean, natural colors and avoid any artificial or extreme filters. Ideally, they can be integrated into any template or format the buyer wants. Simple, timeless clothing without logos works best. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/207613963/Felicidad-by-Nicolas-Fuentes\" alt=\"Felicidad. by Nicolas Fuentes on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/207613963/m%3D900/v2?sig=5bb4762f9073890329e90674a80ef95bde955dc545da8d6a65cea68eec033837\" alt=\"Felicidad. by Nicolas Fuentes on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good stock photography is also timely or seasonal. As we’ve seen, there’s recently been <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/whats-trending-in-licensing-the-covid-19-effect/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a huge demand</a> for lifestyle images related to the global pandemic, including pictures of handwashing, <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/how-to-capture-wellness-selfcare-mindfulness/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wellness, and self-care</a>. Buyers also need photos that reflect our current reality and speak to themes like video-chatting and working from home. </p>\n<p>Some events are hard to predict, but we recommend putting together a Licensing calendar to keep track of timely or seasonal topics. For example, advertisers will start looking for images to use in their holiday promotions months before December, so get those uploaded in advance. </p>\n<p>Similarly, you can shoot some summer vacation themed photos in spring so that travel agencies have time to download and use them in their marketing. If there’s a local festival, holiday, or event in your area, go ahead and cover it (and get those model releases signed). There’s always a surge in demand for these kinds of images when the time rolls around. </p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/8-easy-ways-make-photos-marketable/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8 easy ways to make your photos more marketable</a></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/131472989/Coffee-for-a-stage-magician-by-Dina-Belenko\" alt=\"Coffee for a stage magician by Dina Belenko on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/131472989/m%3D900/v2?sig=6b183d51c7b4824973bdb530f8e1f035d1346e5de73e0f6fe83ac2f5ad268e92\" alt=\"Coffee for a stage magician by Dina Belenko on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What are some recent stock photography trends?</h2>\n<p>In the past few years, we’ve experienced a wave of stock photography trends, from zine-inspired collage to <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/hot-stock-photo-trend-the-return-of-the-double-exposure/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the return of the double exposure</a>.

As for colors, yellow is “in vogue,” and warmly lit interiors are too. </p>\n<p>In commercial stock photography, themes like “women in sport” are breaking down barriers and stereotypes while promoting equality, and customers are continuing to push for diversity in the companies they support. All of these insights speak to a need for honest, inclusive images that inspire trust, and that’s more than a trend–it’s a movement that’s here to stay. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1013923500/Sustainability-by-Iza-?yso?\" alt=\"Sustainability by Iza ?yso? on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1013923500/m%3D900/v2?sig=dc1c1175b29caac5eab303b72b07b1cb65d4cf61acc09e9b2149cd6f1ba808e4\" alt=\"Sustainability by Iza ?yso? on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What tips do we have for emerging stock photographers?</h2>\n<p>Our biggest tip is to approach stock photography as a business.

With that being said, it does have its challenges, among them the fact that you don’t know if and when your photos will sell. That’s where some foresight and planning comes in handy; the more you shoot, the better you’ll get at anticipating buyer’s needs and creating content that works for them. </p>\n<p>Another “challenge” is that you won’t know who bought your photos, but that’s also part of the fun. Seasoned stock photographers have pages of tearsheets and examples or images of theirs that they’ve found “in the wild” throughout the years. You could be reading a magazine on an airplane or browsing books in the mall and come across your photo—that’s the beauty of stock photography. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/259563987/Cooking-class-by-Petra-Ghadamsi\" alt=\"Cooking class by Petra Ghadamsi on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/259563987/m%3D900/v2?sig=af0586d213d9273949006d6a00bef7bac184399d59278ece28cbab6d89c5bae2\" alt=\"Cooking class by Petra Ghadamsi on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Can you make money with stock photography?</h2>\n<p>You can certainly earn money from stock photography—a few years ago, 500px founder Evgeny Tchebotarev made <a href=\"https://medium.com/thoughts-on-photography-1/how-i-made-1-602-50-with-500px-prime-in-just-a-few-weeks-266ef818b1f0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,602.50</a> in just a few weeks—but it usually doesn’t happen overnight. </p>\n<p>There are things you can do to make your photos sellable, like including (model-released) people, adding keywords, and following the briefs set out in 500px Licensing Quests, but still, it takes time to start earning steady money from your work. </p>\n<p>When entering the stock photography business, it’s important to know how it works and what to expect. It’s unlikely that you’ll make a lot of money in a single sale; it’s far more likely that you’ll get a series of smaller payments for multiple downloads over time. These numbers can add up, and that’s when you start seeing returns. </p>\n<p>The photographers who earn a living in stock photography are those who have built up portfolios of thousands of images, applied relevant metadata, and continued to add fresh content. They also aren’t afraid to try new things and adapt to this exciting and fast-paced market. Stock photography isn’t a get-rich-quick deal, but results do come with time, organization, and consistency. </p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/licensing-as-an-investment/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Patience is key: Seeing your Licensing portfolio as a long-term investment</a></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/310896999/leaf-by-Marie-Dashkova\" alt=\"leaf by Marie Dashkova on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/310896999/m%3D900/v2?sig=8106b346e451faa9ab7e78cc7b39fb880a97ecde45ef6c0ff2a0158b5eb075ab\" alt=\"leaf by Marie Dashkova on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Photography is more essential than ever for modern branding, with an estimated <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32%</a> of marketers citing images as the most important form of content for their businesses, and stock photography remains one of the easiest and most reliable resources for companies small and large. </p>\n<p>The market for high-quality, licensable photos has grown tremendously in recent years, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.

      "description": "\n<p>500px Ambassador Taya Ivanova, and gallerists Daniel Cooney and Michael Foley, give their tips for breaking into the genre of fine art photography. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/10-tips-improve-fine-art-photography/\">10 ways to improve your fine art photography</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",
      "content": "\n<p>In 2014, <em>The Guardian</em> columnists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/dec/11/photography-is-art-sean-ohagan-jonathan-jones\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sean O’Hagan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/nov/13/why-photographs-dont-work-in-art-galleries\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Jones</a> revisited an old question: is photography a fine art? </p>\n<p>According to Jones, a photograph could never compete with a painting on a gallery wall. But O’Hagan argued that it didn’t have to—photography is its own medium, independent of other art forms but no less worthy of recognition. </p>\n<p>In the five years since that debate, fine art photography has made its mark on established institutions and up-and-coming galleries alike. Historic museums have opened up new photography wings, and brand new photography museums have cropped up around the world. “[There are] more photography festivals in a month than there used to be in a year,” O’Hagan wrote a few months ago. </p>\n<p>It’s settled, then: photography <em>is</em> a fine art, and a flourishing one at that. But in a field full of possibilities, what separates the outstanding artists from everyone else? We asked 500px Ambassador <a href=\"https://500px.com/tayaiv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Taya Ivanova</a>, in addition to esteemed New York City gallerists Daniel Cooney, owner of <a href=\"https://danielcooneyfineart.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Cooney Fine Art</a>, and Michael Foley, owner of <a href=\"http://www.foleygallery.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Foley Gallery</a>, for their insights and tips for breaking into this ever-changing genre. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/216836373/m%3D900/v2?sig=930fd1fbf49521c51ad5b716d39dc061ffa42e5a761049b0373be35c41d91276\" alt=\"floating by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/216836373/floating-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"floating by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Get personal</h2>\n<p>According to all three experts, the number one trait all great fine art photographers share is a unique perspective. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to reinvent the wheel, but it does mean you have to be willing to put yourself on the line in some way. “What moves my interest is when you put everything at stake,” Michael explains. “It’s work that’s often vulnerable or personal.” </p>\n<p>If a photograph feels scary and exciting because it reveals something about who you are, you’ve struck gold. We all have thoughts, fantasies, and taboos that we keep hidden from view—art can shine a light on them in mysterious and powerful ways. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/219461737/oh-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"oh by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/219461737/m%3D900/v2?sig=d0f6d1a78bed33c2c3a2bd0136c23b6976e5a613cbb21857d8f35a9fca9b4fef\" alt=\"oh by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Take a self-portrait, even if it’s just for yourself</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, an easy way to tap into your psyche and discover your voice is to stand in front of the camera, not behind it. “Many of my photos are self-portraits,” Taya tells us. “Photographing myself has taught me how to be more empathetic, shown me that I deserve to feel comfortable in my own skin, and encouraged me to find beauty in every part of my life. </p>\n<p>“One of the best things it has given me is the ability to connect with other people. I’ve noticed that no matter who I talk to, artist or not, they find it easier to open up to me when they see that I’ve shared so many emotional photos of myself.” </p>\n<p>You can lay yourself bare like Nan Goldin, or dress up and play a role like Cindy Sherman. Maybe you take one picture and move on, or perhaps you spend decades refining the art of the self-portrait. The important thing is to get to know yourself as a person and a photographer. When asked why she usually photographed herself, Francesca Woodman famously replied, “I’m always available.” </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/308154923/m%3D900/v2?sig=3750aec2d8c7c14e1e02d91e28fda21747b4f59fd7eec7e9cade140b4995b232\" alt=\"you can feel her warmth inviting you to dance by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/308154923/you-can-feel-her-warmth-inviting-you-to-dance-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"you can feel her warmth inviting you to dance by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Break the rules</h2>\n<p>After decades in the business, Daniel and Michael agree that there’s no one way to be an artist. Even a commercial shoot can slip into the fine art world given the right intentions and circumstances. William Eggleston started shooting color transparency film at a time when it was mostly used for advertisements; in fact, the art world considered color to be “vulgar.” Michael notes, “Because of that, Eggleston had a lasting influence, and the great thing is, he likely had no idea he was doing so.” </p>\n<p>So if someone tells you a camera, a lens, a film, or a style isn’t suited to fine art, prove them wrong. “I wish I’d been more experimental early on in my career,” Taya explains. “If your favorite genre is fine art, that’s amazing. But don’t let it limit you. Experiment with landscape, macro photography, surrealism, fashion photography, etc. If I could define ‘fine art’ and describe it in one word, I’d call it open-minded. All photographs can be considered fine art if they’re shot a certain way.” </p>\n<h2>4. Use any camera you can get your hands on (or no camera at all)</h2>\n<p>When Taya first got started, she had a phone with a 2-megapixel camera, and it worked just fine. An unusual or underrated tool can be the greatest gift. Man Ray didn’t even use a camera to create his famous rayographs, and his method is still relevant today. </p>\n<p>“There are contemporary photographs out there now that sell for tens of thousands of dollars that do not involve a camera,” Michael says. “Find the appropriate gear for your imagery. Want to use an oatmeal can to make a pinhole camera? Fantastic! Feel you need a Phase One? Go for it. Believe me; I don’t care. Just make it work with your subject.” </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/262824569/m%3D900/v2?sig=46f2da37cc14d076ff508129b7993e38d56261da0e0df3be9da9b55915db41a6\" alt=\"*** by oprisco  on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/262824569/-by-oprisco-\" alt=\"*** by oprisco  on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Step into the past</h2>\n<p>“I love that people are going back and exploring early techniques in photography and applying contemporary perspectives,” Daniel tells us. Try alternative processes, like daguerreotypes or tintypes, and put a fresh spin on an old classic. Not only will the exercise push you out of your comfort zone, but it’ll also connect you with your photographic roots. </p>\n<p>These days, you can do almost anything digitally, but Taya suggests slowing down and working manually as much as possible. It takes more time, but the results are worth it. “I like seeing practical effects, meaning props that you don’t add in Photoshop,” she says. “Some things are impossible not to edit in, but there’s something special about making an entire set with your own hands. <a href=\"https://500px.com/oprisco\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Oleg Oprisco</a> and <a href=\"https://www.timwalkerphotography.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Walker</a> are brilliant examples of this.” </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/134201783/m%3D900/v2?sig=805ba075ab1bc492d615015230819a06f8f2e364b4990e56c6e6f08d42442f79\" alt=\"Hymn of Hathor by Vesa Kivinen on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/134201783/Hymn-of-Hathor-by-Vesa-Kivinen\" alt=\"Hymn of Hathor by Vesa Kivinen on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. Experiment with collage</h2>\n<p>If we push the handmade trend to its limits, we venture into collage territory. “Collage is peaking in all media right now,” Michael says. “I think it’s in part a reflection of the world right now that seems so darn fractured and fragmented. This can be digital collaging or cutting the paper—either way.” </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/167105361/m%3D900/v2?sig=9b341e76b06d2a89bc973a38d3975829e08da94adef3077fd1d8a303ceb1828c\" alt=\"the smell of other people's houses II by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/167105361/the-smell-of-other-people-s-houses-II-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"the smell of other people's houses II by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. Reach out often</h2>\n<p>“I’d tell any emerging photographer to connect with artists they admire,” Taya says. “Don’t be shy. Be fearless. I happily reply to every email I get, so you can always message me if you need a little guidance.” </p>\n<p>Daniel agrees that forging creative connections is the way to go, adding, “I don’t mind being contacted by artists, [but] I think that artists benefit the most by building their networks of other artists.” </p>\n<h2>8. But know when to disconnect</h2>\n<p>Taya makes a clear distinction between connection and comparison. Connecting with artists, editors, and gallerists is the best way to learn, but at the same time, it’s important not to give too much credence to what other people think. </p>\n<p>“Listen to your intuition,” Taya advises. “It’s easy to get lost in the world of social media, where everyone has a specific style and every successful photographer has millions of followers. While these things are wonderful, they mustn’t define the value of your work. Photography should be something that fulfills you and lifts your spirits, not another reason to feel stressed.” </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/281083963/wanheda-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"wanheda by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/281083963/m%3D900/v2?sig=6654f78992a740980978c27106669b6ca098953202e15c201cf8882461fea5aa\" alt=\"wanheda by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>9. Print your work</h2>\n<p>“These days, everyone is a photographer—<em>everyone</em>—and viewers are much more sophisticated because we are bombarded by images and understand them better on an instinctual level,” Daniel says. “As a result, I’m personally more interested in photographs that are tactile and have an actual presence in the world beyond a screen. </p>\n<p>“Photographers have to realize that they are making objects, at least in my part of the world. Looking at print-outs or images on an iPad doesn’t work for me. I need to see photographic prints as I would see them on a wall.” Maybe you print them at home, or you send them to a lab. Whatever you choose, learn how the process works, and experiment with different methods and papers. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/258022187/m%3D900/v2?sig=3d331c1c9b59123babdde9729ba7f6e45f10e55338a4e3afb2cef5bdeb71ef6e\" alt=\"Queer by Inna Mosina on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/258022187/Queer-by-Inna-Mosina\" alt=\"Queer by Inna Mosina on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>10. Take a stand</h2>\n<p>The journey of a fine artist often starts with the individual (see tips 1 and 2), but as you grow, you’ll grapple with complex, universal, and timely subjects. “There is movement toward content that is culturally or politically topical,” Michael tells us. “We talk more and more about how photography and the people making it are reflecting contemporary culture more.” </p>\n<p>That’s not to say that the work has to be overtly political, but it needs to have conviction. Think about the subjects that motivate you and use your creativity as a way to express what matters most. </p>\n<p><strong>Click <a href=\"https://web.500px.com/licensing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here to learn more</a> about Licensing with 500px.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/10-tips-improve-fine-art-photography/\">10 ways to improve your fine art photography</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

Our guide will walk you through the Model Mayhem process and explain how to address any issues that might arise. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/227707621/m%3D900/v2?sig=515bab54df605eecae4abc1c6da46157c61f1475867a81df72d17c6e36727dab\" alt=\"Model Mayhem - Mame Anta by fabien Mir on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/227707621/Mame-Anta-by-fabien-Mir\" alt=\"Model Mayhem - Mame Anta by fabien Mir on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to use Model Mayhem</h2>\n<p>Model Mayhem is a site that connects models with people who have both paid and unpaid work for them. Models can send out notices to let photographers and recruiters know they’re ready to work, or they can respond to casting calls. </p>\n<p>As a photographer searching for models, you can look through their’ profiles on the platform to find the right fit for your project. They may have references, previous work examples, and sample images to help you make your decision. Once you connect with a model, it’s up to you to communicate your needs clearly, work out <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/5-best-practices-getting-model-release/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the model release</a>, and ask any necessary questions to confirm their suitability.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/298647317/m%3D900/v2?sig=15b6bbb753be58f3316428aea39f5b7a52c0cd19aca35562fed09ec5d54c5901\" alt=\"Model Mayam - Ana by Valeria schettino on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/298647317/Ana-by-Valeria-schettino\" alt=\"Model Mayhem - Ana by Valeria schettino on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Communication with Mayhem models</h2>\n<p>Your plan will determine how many casting messages, friend requests, and message folders you can use, and when. (See the full breakdown of membership benefits across the three plans — Basic, Premium, and VIP — <a href=\"https://www.modelmayhem.com/registration/membership_benefits\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.) </p>\n<p>When you do message with a potential model, provide some information about yourself. Explain why you’re doing this project and share your own qualifications. Offer to let them see your portfolio. Listen to any ideas they may have about your shoot (even if you already have a concrete plan, it will give you a clue about the kind of work they do). Keep your communications professional to set the tone for a professional working relationship.</p>\n<p>Let them know what to expect from you in terms of workflow, turnaround, and method of payment. Make sure they know what they’re getting into, so there are no hiccups on the day of the shoot. You should be able to perform basic communication, including attaching some files for reference, in the Model Mayhem system before switching to email or phone communication.  </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/310447523/m%3D900/v2?sig=d06de17c49d24f43219433f67c23133deff600018fc83348dec6e74b32dde1c1\" alt=\"Model Mayhem - Erika by Nicola Davide Furnari on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/310447523/Erika-by-Nicola-Davide-Furnari\" alt=\"Model Mayhem -- Erika by Nicola Davide Furnari on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Setting up casting calls</h2>\n<p>To circulate information about your project, and get responses from models, send out a <a href=\"https://www.modelmayhem.com/education/photography/11060-how-to-use-model-mayhem-casting-calls-to-book-models\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">casting call</a>. You can do this by selecting “Castings” from the menu at the top of Model Mayhem. Then enter the information about your project. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/238450529/m%3D900/v2?sig=fdef0bfc1e5fd663380a1b4697815732baa6ee50e79e336f21b4f3fbbbb446d5\" alt=\"Model Mayhem - Matyouz of the House of LaDurée by Alejandro Santiago on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/238450529/Matyouz-of-the-House-of-LaDur%C3%A9e-by-Alejandro-Santiago\" alt=\"Model Mayhem -Matyouz of the House of LaDurée by Alejandro Santiago on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The number of casting calls you’re allowed per week depends on your Model Mayhem plan. The Basic plan comes with only one casting call per week, while Premium comes with five, and VIP comes with 10.

However, take precautions any time you are working with internet strangers. The most important thing is to know that the person you’re working with is who they say they are. You can confirm this in the ways highlighted below.</p>\n<h3>Check references</h3>\n<p>A model’s work history should tell you a lot about how successful your collaboration will be. <a href=\"https://www.modelmayhem.com/education/modeling/11340-how-to-check-references-in-the-modeling-industry\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Checking references</a> may seem like a hassle, but it’s the best way to hear firsthand about what to expect from your model. Look in their Credit Notes for more information, including collaborations they’ve done outside of Model Mayhem. If you don’t see helpful information on Model Mayhem, you can look at their other online presence as well. </p>\n<p>When you do make contact with a reference, ask about the model’s professionalism, what type of work they’ve done, and what impact their participation had on the project as a whole.</p>\n<h3>Look for Verified Credits</h3>\n<p>As you’re searching for references, you may see some models with <a href=\"https://www.modelmayhem.com/education/using-mm/10749-how-to-use-verified-credits\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Verified Credits</a>. This means the model has worked with another Model Mayhem member, who confirmed their collaboration. A Verified Credit will show you, right there in the platform, definite experience the model has under their belt. </p>\n<h3>Make sure someone knows where you are</h3>\n<p>When you meet with a model for the first time, especially if you’re meeting alone, make sure someone knows where you’ll be. Tell them how long you’ll be there and make plans to text or call at a certain time afterward. </p>\n<h3>Don’t neglect your paperwork</h3>\n<p>Model Mayhem is a way to connect, not a CRM. You’ll need to work out a contract and model release on your own, along with a way to pay your model (or exchange images, if you are doing a Time for Print agreement). </p>\n<h3>Know when something isn’t right</h3>\n<p>If your spidey sense starts tingling, listen to it. Don’t give away personal or financial information that you aren’t comfortable with and only click third-party links that you know, for sure, are safe. Lastly, don’t communicate with someone claiming to be from Model Mayhem if you suspect they are lying. Model Mayhem will always contact you via an @modelmayhem.com email address, and they will never email you asking for a username or password. </p>\n<p><em>Finding models on Model Mayhem is not difficult once you know the process and what to look out for.

      "content": "\n<p>Moody, low-key photographs are trending, popping up everywhere from magazine spreads to social media feeds. Much of today’s tabletop food photography harkens back to old master paintings and their dramatic use of chiaroscuro, and long, graphic shadows and rustic backgrounds have filtered into modern still life images as well. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/257093961/m%3D900/v2?sig=d6437deb1c4ada9e6a059c3c5e3f4495ab53e0e8c7b1d5db2b9dc65056e1b628\" alt=\"Apples by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/257093961/Apples-by-Raquel-Carmona-Romero\" alt=\"Apples by Raquel Carmona Romero on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Darker backgrounds are cropping up in portrait photography, still life photography, macro photography, and beyond. In 2019, Instagram made waves by introducing “dark mode,” resulting in one of the largest tech and design trends in the foreseeable future. </p>\n<p>As John Kyeremeh wrote in <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/take-photos-with-color-wheel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> on colors, black is also popular in commercial photography, used to market luxury products ranging from watches to cars. Getty Images named “The Dark Arts” as one of their emerging trends, citing brands like Bellocq Tea Atelier and magazines like <em>Ambrosia</em> and their use of rich, dark colors. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/110962739/m%3D900/v2?sig=b3e16c264408431b88635033453f3391b2d6a1b9ef21078a6a9b7b5270e6e2b5\" alt=\"Ivan by Daniil Kontorovich on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/110962739/Ivan-by-Daniil-Kontorovich\" alt=\"Ivan by Daniil Kontorovich on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the simplest ways to get this dramatic look is to use a physical backdrop. If you have access to seamless paper, you can set it up at home or in the studio; alternatively, you can pull out some construction paper or browse a fabric store for a velvet or velour backdrop that suits your needs. These fabrics won’t crease, and that’s important when working with black backgrounds. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/301139457/m%3D900/v2?sig=238bdf2efdf643bb6bbcdfb5560eab09452cd9686d6fec7703f9aef676ba4919\" alt=\"Caylen by Ted Belton on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/301139457/Caylen-by-Ted-Belton\" alt=\"Caylen by Ted Belton on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some situations, a bedsheet will also work; just take some time to smooth it out before the shoot. </p>\n<p>With a little creativity, you can use all sorts of materials as backgrounds; Irving Penn famously used an old theater curtain while photographing the Paris collections for Vogue. Whatever paper or fabric you choose, it’s important that it absorbs light rather than reflects it. That means no shiny metals or plastics, just matte materials. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/243375715/m%3D900/v2?sig=9571f528b60d3d4d14142c723425b8f7dc1146acee3554c5e9541dff7deeeceb\" alt=\"Marina by Yang Shuo on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/243375715/Marina-by-Yang-Shuo-\" alt=\"Marina by Yang Shuo on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you don’t have a physical black backdrop—or you’re working in a situation where it isn’t feasible, (e.g., you’re outside, don’t have access to a studio, or plan to change location throughout the shoot)—you can still achieve a similar aesthetic using lighting and your camera settings. </p>\n<p>We touched on value a bit in our articles on color theory (<a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/color-theory-photographers-introduction-color-wheel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/color-theory-photographers-part-2-hue-saturation-value/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), but here’s a quick refresher: when we say “value,” we’re simply referring to how light or dark a color is. White is the lightest, and black is the darkest; all other colors fall somewhere in between. When you mix dark areas and light ones, you’re creating value contrast in your photos. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/281316811/m%3D900/v2?sig=fe518ea4ed6d3c67a6126a673a4c840fdecb0bfeb922ec54083d99610221ffad\" alt=\"Phototherapy by Lisaweta Wlasenko on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/281316811/Phototherapy-by-Lisaweta-Wlasenko\" alt=\"Phototherapy by Lisaweta Wlasenko on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whatever your location, be it indoors or outdoors, the secret to a good black background can lie in finding (or creating) value contrast between your subject and the background. </p>\n<p>Photographers have a few ways of determining if and when a setting has enough contrast to work; some like to squint to check if a scene lacks contrast. You also shoot or preview your photos in black and white to get a better understanding of light and value without the distraction of color. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1007068832/m%3D900/v2?sig=3a9bce7b52be074b753f0ef37c097101caf0b2fc5ff146007ea460c05ae861eb\" alt=\"Fathers Love by Shahadat Hossain on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1007068832/Fathers-Love--by-Shahadat--Hossain\" alt=\"Fathers Love by Shahadat Hossain on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you’re outdoors, look for nice daylight and shady areas; doorways and dark buildings work well for these kinds of shoots. You’ll then want to place your subject in the light in front of the shaded spot, close to the border line where light meets shade. Remember: you’re not only looking for dark areas but also areas where there’s a noticeable contrast between light and dark. You can also underexpose a bit so the background is as dark as possible. </p>\n<p>If you’re indoors, that physical black background will come in handy, especially if you’re shooting in a room with reflective white walls—but it’s possible to make do without one. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/102385037/m%3D900/v2?sig=31c84af23d98ad545a2068343830a72a3a637d6794bf7a20ed36b64de05b433a\" alt=\"Silence by Maja Topcagic on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/102385037/Silence-by-Maja-Topcagic\" alt=\"Silence by Maja Topcagic on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you find that there isn’t enough contrast for a rich black background indoors, consider bringing in a (modified) studio light of your choice to illuminate just your subject. You can also use natural light if you’re working inside; turn out the lights and block out all the windows (blackout curtains work here) except for one. You can even use a stencil to shape the light. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/301515429/m%3D900/v2?sig=d25b516a2572387cd374a2bce8653e6fea9d3c091a27ea48469e3a27b0767380\" alt=\"Kate by alexander kan on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/301515429/Kate-by-alexander-kan\" alt=\"Kate by alexander kan on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regardless of the light source, keep your subject and main light at a solid distance from your background to make it easier to achieve that contrast. If it’s a wall, make sure your subject is far enough from it so it doesn’t get any of the light that’s illuminating the face. Regardless of the paint color on the wall itself, it will get progressively darker as you move your light and subject farther away. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/258666633/m%3D900/v2?sig=de15d53b266e2be09c5b4767c6d2680b60b79ac8e4affb624ad4f88a6e9bf7a6\" alt=\"... by Michal Jasiocha on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/258666633/-by-Michal-Jasiocha-\" alt=\"... by Michal Jasiocha on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can use a solid or net flag to control the light and prevent it from hitting your background. If you don’t have a studio flag, firm black paper or foam board will do the trick. A reflector will also come in handy for modifying the light and bouncing it back on the model’s face. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/166137587/m%3D900/v2?sig=d79448fed59f98b9bafe7ad9fe7960b7de8a09573c4d3cc50dfbfc1d9afeffb9\" alt=\"JR Maddox by Glyn Dewis on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/166137587/JR-Maddox-by-Glyn-Dewis\" alt=\"JR Maddox by Glyn Dewis on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>It’s also possible to mimic the effect of a black backdrop by using a clever technique the photographer and educator <a href=\"https://500px.com/glyndewis\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Glyn Dewis</a> has dubbed <a href=\"https://glyndewis.com/the-invisible-black-backdrop-photography-technique/?v=79cba1185463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“the invisible black backdrop.”</a> You only need an off-camera flash and a camera to try it out—no studio necessary. </p>\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n<p>Before you even bring out your flash, adjust your settings so that you’re able to take an entirely blank, black photo. Set ISO as low as possible to reduce your camera’s sensitivity to light, and use your camera’s fastest shutter sync speed. </p>\n<p>If you’re still getting a brighter exposure than you’d like, feel free to stop down your aperture to minimize the amount of light entering your camera. You want to block out all the natural light in the scene. </p>\n<p>Once that’s done, there’s only one step left: set up your flash how and where you want it—and trigger it to light your subject. It’s easier to do this one outside, of course, because white walls will reflect that light, but it’s possible to do it indoors as well with some careful placement. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1009816419/m%3D900/v2?sig=2ce6e79ba0823cbc70b3c93bd220bfac011932240d427182057ad7045cd5001b\" alt=\"Perfect timing by Stuart Mckenna on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1009816419/Perfect-timing-by-Stuart-Mckenna\" alt=\"Perfect timing by Stuart Mckenna on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, you can always enhance your black background in post-processing. The most obvious places to start would be your contrast, shadows, and blacks sliders; to finesse, feel free to tweak the levels and curves. Keep an eye on your histogram while you’re doing this, and again, don’t be afraid to temporarily convert your photo to black and white just so you can see the contrast more clearly. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/295085011/m%3D900/v2?sig=08f29e78828da0b7c3387c8b4942fc77bb0d1a39efe32a448b244ef7b339accf\" alt=\"Nika by Alexander Sviridov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/295085011/Nika-by-Alexander-Sviridov\" alt=\"Nika by Alexander Sviridov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the days of film photography, artists might have used the dodging and burning technique to brighten up their subjects and darken their backgrounds. If you’re a film photographer with access to the darkroom, you can do the same. Expose the background of your prints to more light, and use a dodging device (like cardboard) to block it from hitting your subject.  </p>\n<p>If you’re working digitally, familiarize yourself with the burn tool in Photoshop or any comparable software. Set the range to “shadows,” and gradually expose any background areas you’d like to make darker; a light touch here is crucial, but it works well if you have spots of light hitting your background. If you’re worried about shifting colors, make sure to select the “protect tones” option. You can also make local corrections to your background by bringing out your brush tool. </p>\n<p>Finally, feel free to view your photos on multiple devices to make sure the dark areas are as dark as you’d like them to be; as the photographer Pedro Quintela explains in <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/5-secrets-every-photographer-should-learn/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this guide</a>, you don’t want to be surprised when you print your images and find that they’re not as you imagined. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1009953706/m%3D900/v2?sig=8ad638e24c8fe2cf1aff0be8ceacf5073939a6f46264ed98d010c7adbb5eed85\" alt=\"january 2020 self portrait by Amanda Carlson on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1009953706/january-2020-self-portrait--by-Amanda-Carlson\" alt=\"january 2020 self portrait by Amanda Carlson on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>We’ve already mentioned the timeliness of the “black background movement,” but it’s equally important to recognize the timelessness of this theme. Darker backgrounds are more than a passing trend; they’re a longstanding tradition, and some of the best examples are also the oldest. </p>\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://karsh.org/overview/portraits/#thumbnails\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yousuf Karsh’s portraits</a> of Ernest Hemingway or Muhammad Ali, or browse <a href=\"http://philippehalsman.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Philippe Halsman’s photographs</a> of Salvador Dali; study the way they use light and contrast to create evocative, inky backgrounds—and how those backgrounds heighten the drama of the scene. The cameras might have changed, but many same principles that applied to them still apply to photographers today. </p>\n<p><b>You Might Also Like These Articles:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/a-beginners-guide-to-photography/\"><u>A Beginners Guide to Photography | The Essential Guide</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/white-background-photography/\"><u>How to shoot on a white background and tips on editing a white background like a pro</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/creative-self-portraits/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>50 Creative Self-Portrait Ideas To Trump All Selfies</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sample-male-poses/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>21 Poses To Try When Photographing Men</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sample-female-poses-photographing-models/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>16 Classic and Unique Poses for Photographing Women</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/35-mobile-photography-tips-thatll-help-you-take-incredible-smartphone-shots/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>35 Mobile Photography Tips For Taking Better Smartphone Shots</u></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/using-black-background-in-photography/\">The essential guide to creating a black background for your photos</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p><strong>Having a unique photoshoot is all about being prepared, and this guide is designed to help you think about ways to keep your photos fresh.</strong></p>\n<p><em><u><a href=\"https://500px.com/bettinabogar\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bettina Bogar</a></u> a Toronto-based photographer and creative director from Europe walks us through producing creative photo shoot ideas. She began her career in Budapest, before moving to Canada to further her creative goals. She specializes in commercial photography and has shot for brands like Lululemon, Airbnb, and Tim Hortons. In this post, in collaboration with the 500px Blog, she shares her insights into producing your own photo shoot.</em></p>\n<p>Whether you’re just starting out or years into your career, creating new, original photos should always be a top priority for photographers. Here’s why:</p>\n<p><strong>1. It keeps your portfolio fresh, your creativity sharp, and will push you outside your comfort zone.</strong> Art directors are always on the lookout for unique concepts, and who knows what kind of dream job you could land based on a single photo? </p>\n<p><strong>2. People shop your feed/portfolio just like an e-commerce store.</strong> Unfortunately, in most cases, it doesn’t matter that you know how to shoot certain things if you don’t show it. Because most people don’t think outside the box, you have to create content around subjects that will be attractive to shoot in the future. People will hire you based on those images, and likely, will ask you to replicate them for their own brand. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/201855221/m%3D900/v2?user_id=19483789&amp;webp=true&amp;sig=4f11662b6440abe5ff0782791b13c898c7da7a1ec32acf0ccc003f3363ad8797\" alt=\"Charmaine by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/201855221/charmaine-by-bettina-bogar\" alt=\"Charmaine by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bringing your vision to life is always so much fun, but there are certain steps you have to take to make it really successful. With spring and summer upon us, it’s actually a great time to start planning creative photo shoots. </p>\n<p>This process has helped me over the years, and I’m confident it will help you too!</p>\n<h2>1. Pick a goal for your photo shoot</h2>\n<p>Coming up with a creative idea is something that scares most people, but it doesn’t have to be that difficult. I always suggest picking a goal for these images first. Are they going to live on your website? Are you going to <a href=\"https://marketplace.500px.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sell them on 500px</a>? Are you going to submit them to a magazine? Picking a goal will help you keep focused.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/201854351/m%3D900/v2?webp=true&amp;sig=8411c4650f4a4939140f18c55883459004f42e1968eebd942f867839ebdf6536\" alt=\"Ice Cream Truck by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/201854351/ice-cream-truck-by-bettina-bogar\" alt=\"Ice Cream Truck by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Create a concept for your photo shoot</h2>\n<p>Once you have a goal, it’s time to figure out the concept. I always suggest something simple, instead of something complex. Pick a single theme, and the rest will flow together. Based on your theme, create a mood board, which will be the base plan for your photo shoot. Browse images on <a href=\"https://500px.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">500px</a>, Pinterest, Instagram, or go through photography magazines that you like. Remember, this is a very important part, so spend some time building out your own unique concept. Look for use of light, poses, expressions, locations, outfits, makeup—basically decide on every little detail before you even reach out to people. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/188188869/m%3D900/v2?user_id=19483789&amp;webp=true&amp;sig=410ffc30d0fef2ba6f648aa23aeb9dd972f071716f0f0c30f4e4c77f6031159e\" alt=\"photo shoot - Oshiis x Puerto Viejo by BettinaBogar by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/188188869/oshiis-x-puerto-viejo-by-bettinabogar-by-bettina-bogar\" alt=\"photo shoot -Oshiis x Puerto Viejo by BettinaBogar by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Produce your photos from the photo shoot</h2>\n<p>The devil is in the details. Once you have your final mood board and theme, you can put on your producer hat. Since you’ve already spent a good chunk of time creating this concept, you may as well get the best people and location for your work.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Figure out the location and dates—are you shooting in a studio or on location? If on location, do you need a permit? What’s the forecast for that day? How busy will the place be at the time of the shoot? It’s always worth it to do a little scouting beforehand. </li>\n<li>Equipment: do you need any special gear? Lights? Stands? Modifiers? Backdrops?</li>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/201850591/m%3D900/v2?user_id=19483789&amp;webp=true&amp;sig=c04e89195bae1bea48c504e02f7b5313ea03ddbe0e80d6e34467e5b3e045b305\" alt=\"photo shoot -Charmaine by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/201850591/charmaine-by-bettina-bogar\" alt=\"photo shoot -Charmaine by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<li>Hire your crew for your photo shoot:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Model(s): Go pro here. Local model agencies and scouts are always looking to get fresh photos of their talent. Reach out, send over a little intro about yourself, your portfolio, your dates, concept, and mood board, and if they like what you’re up to, you’re likely going to have a few faces from which to choose.</li>\n<li>Makeup &amp; hair: It’s essential to have a really talented makeup artist and hair stylist on your team, especially if you want your work to look stunning, as well as to save yourself tons of time retouching. Be sure to schedule time and a place for makeup and hair before the shoot, and ask the artists to stay with you during the shoot for touch-ups.</li>\n<li>Wardrobe stylist: There are so many talented freelance wardrobe stylists out there; try to get in touch with a few: you will be blown away by how much a great wardrobe piece can add to your images.</li>\n<li>Assistant: It’s the best thing ever to have someone assist you on a shoot. There are so many moving parts, and it’s always super nice to have an extra set of hands on-set. </li>\n\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have all of these things organized, you’re good to go. Be sure to circulate a call sheet before the shoot day so everyone is well-informed.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/201830747/m%3D900/v2?user_id=19483789&amp;webp=true&amp;sig=71e1f7bbb03449b7a7fc174ea0075b38bc223965a78f74175820d75108ab6dda\" alt=\"photo shoot -Beach Lulu by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/201830747/beach-lulu-by-bettina-bogar\" alt=\"photo shoot -Beach Lulu by Bettina Bogar on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Have fun</h2>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least: have fun creating.

She goes into detail on a woman’s perspective on nude photography, and the sometimes blurry line between ‘fine art’ and ‘softcore porn.’ </b></p>\n<p>Last year, the Nevada Museum of Art hosted a major retrospective exhibition of the late photographer Anne Brigman (1869-1950), whom many consider to have been a feminist artist in a time before “feminism” was even a word.</p>\n<p>In the early 1900s, then in her thirties, she ventured into the Sierra Nevada wilderness, where she created nude photographs and <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/behind-the-scenes-how-to-shoot-a-nude-self-portrait-with-benjamin-von-wong-sfw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>nude portraits</u></a>–many of them self-portraits of herself and her sisters in a rugged, natural landscape. For a woman at the turn of the century, it was a bold and subversive move; many call it revolutionary.</p>\n<p>It’s been more than a century since Brigman created some of her most nude photographs, but for decades, she remained largely in the shadows. Her relative obscurity comes into even sharper focus when compared to the successes of male photographers like Edward Weston, who famously photographed his muse, Charis Wilson, in the nude.</p>\n<p>The history of nude photography has, at least to some extent, left out the female perspective–both as photographers and models.

At least that was my opinion on most contemporary nude photographers when I first started doing photography, nearly 9 years ago, with a narrow mind and an old 35mm camera.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/126732353/Lucid-by-Lauren-Naylor\" alt=\"Lucid by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/126732353/m%3D900/v2?sig=8e749fb143f60b9810068fcaf2c8f74f6aa06932975f7ea78b9c5a27b2cb9ae3\" alt=\"Lucid by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>“I would have never thought back then, shooting double exposures of clouds and street signs, that I would be shooting nude photos of women, and definitely not of myself, in the present day. I had admired the work of Helmut Newton and Edward Weston (and still do!), but thought those good old days of ‘nude vs. naked’ were long gone and all that was left were hidden motives.</p>\n<p>“After learning the photography basics and becoming bored of the double exposures, I slowly started trying on fine art portraiture and grew to fall deeply in love with it. My portraits took on many styles in the early years, as all developing photographers come to terms with that difficult question, “What the hell do I want to shoot and how do I create a body of work that is my own??</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/120320395/Flee-by-Lauren-Naylor\" alt=\"Flee by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/120320395/m%3D900/v2?sig=8c73346688c253200b91a45093da1ccd6e79b7622e07e5612a6fdd40e75ffd69\" alt=\"Flee by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>“It wasn’t until a few years ago that I started to feel like I had found my niche in photography, and a personal style began to develop.

All that’s left is human emotion. And most of the time clothing distracts from that concept and all the feelings that go along with it. Nude photography and self-portraiture began to take on a life in my work.</p>\n<p>“When a photographer shoots their subjects in the nude without a sexual motivation (whether underlying or not), one has to wonder what IS the meaning behind it?</p>\n<p>“The reason for me goes back to the general concept behind my work: Pure emotion.</p>\n<p>“When someone looks at my photos I want them to get lost in the ethereal detachment, unburdened by all things except pure feeling or mood. Emotions have always been held at the highest in my life, and they have always been the key to most of my decision making.</p>\n<p>“Clothing is just one thing that can take a person out of that ethereal world of feeling.? It dates and defines a culture. It can define what kind of person the model is supposed to be, and can also define the mood of a photograph, which can in turn clash with the intended mood.</p>\n<p>“When I started shooting without the distraction of clothing I discovered such an ease to my conceptual process. Looking back at my earlier personal work, I find it almost silly that I was trying to incorporate elaborate clothing into photos with such a strong tie to nature and the simplest of essences that makes us all a part of it.</p>\n<p>“Every nude photographer has their own approach, but I personally am not necessarily focusing on the subject’s body or the beauty of their anatomy when I’m shooting.”</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/127472937/Loss-and-Gain-by-Lauren-Naylor\" alt=\"Loss and Gain by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/127472937/m%3D900/v2?sig=c00b3c19140211359124eac2ff4ec347f07222d5e1e56be2e5af2d41540c41d7\" alt=\"Loss and Gain by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>For Brigman, the early 20th-century nude photographer and self-portraitist, nudity also wasn’t about anatomy or physical desire so much as it was about spiritual and emotional storytelling. “My pictures tell of my freedom of soul, of my emancipation from fear,” she wrote in 1913. Like Lauren, she was the subject of her own narrative rather than an object for male pleasure.</p>\n<p>Brigman’s early career in nude photography coincided with the fight for women’s suffrage; Lauren’s coincides with modern feminist movements like #MeToo and Time’s Up. It might be a coincidence, but perhaps the likelier explanation is that during times of revolution and rebellion, female nude photographers have helped change–and continue to reshape–the way we see women, female body, and <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/illusions-of-the-body-nude-series-challenges-body-image-norms-nsfw/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">body image</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Female Gaze in Nude Photography</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/116649475/Arches-and-Light-by-Lauren-Naylor\" alt=\"Arches and Light by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/116649475/m%3D900/v2?sig=741ee1415a17706cf0b7967f83a63ce3e633d5874fa3290206ad393598f19a46\" alt=\"Arches and Light by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p><br>\nLauren Naylor: “Most of my subjects are female, probably because I can more easily relate and channel my concepts and moods through women better than I can with men. Men have always been a challenge for me, but I never want to stop pushing myself and experimenting with new things that make me nervous.”</p>\n<p>The boundaries between art, nude photography, and erotica have always been murky. Around the turn of the 20th century, as cameras became more accessible, the “erotic postcard” came into its own. These postcard-size prints were easy to hide, and they often changed hands discreetly in the hushed corners of bookstores and tobacconists.</p>\n<p>As it happens, however, it was also around this time that photographers started thinking of themselves as artists. <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/40-fine-art-nude-photos-that-celebrate-all-shapes-and-sizes-nsfw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>Fine art nude</u></a> photography and these clandestine postcards came of age in roughly the same era, and in some cases, they overlapped. For example, early manufactures of erotic materials sometimes used the blanket of “fine art” nude photography to evade censorship and the authorities.</p>\n<p>Today, this “gray area” persists–making nude photography a timeless but sensitive subject amongst artists.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Line Between Fine Art and Softcore Porn</strong></h3>\n<p>Lauren Naylor: “Unfortunately, what I said above about photographers with ulterior motives wasn’t completely off-base. It has always been a controversial topic with an unfortunate amount of truth to the negative side of it. Let me start off by saying in no way is this every nude photographers’ agenda and every model/subject has a choice of which kinds of photographs they partake in and what kinds of poses they agree to do, of course.</p>\n<p>“The topic of controversy is the amount of ‘fine art’ nude photography that is out there today that is unquestionably distasteful in nature. Most of the time it involves overly suggestive posing that borders on the line of, yes, softcore porn. That’s fine if you’re shooting boudoir, but most of the time that wasn’t the intended purpose.</p>\n<p>“I can’t help but feel like these kinds of photos are becoming more and more prevalent in modern photography and I would love to see this trend fade away into the abyss of the outdated what-the-hell-were-they-thinking category.</p>\n<p>“When I hear about talented photographers shooting nudes inside my own community that are bragging about their sexual escapades with their models, it’s even more of a buzz kill. I have a problem with this, not because of the personal decisions made by model and photographer (hey, do whatever you want!), but because it’s disheartening to have such faith in an artistic concept, only to have it unmasked as just a phony imitation.</p>\n<p>“It’s like finding out that your favorite band actually buys all of their lyrics and doesn’t write anything themselves. The authenticity you once trusted in and sang along to (or maybe even cried to) during one of those long agonizing breakups is now void.</p>\n<p>“It can be a controversial subject with a sometimes very fine line between tasteful and…not. However, I think that nude photography plays a huge part in how I communicate through my photographs, and I’ll continue to stand on the ‘nude’ side, doing my best to advocate creativity, not crass.”</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/127065979/Deep-In-A-Quiet-Storm-by-Lauren-Naylor\" alt=\"Nude photography - Deep In A Quiet Storm by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/127065979/m%3D900/v2?sig=16acb2721815e512a5fde6d566b63fd0507a3cbfe874c803d6dc9c17b42ef16f\" alt=\"Nude photography - Deep In A Quiet Storm by Lauren Naylor on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>What exactly does it mean to take nude photographs that are creative rather than crass?

Communicate with your models about your goals for the nude photography shoot, and ask for their feedback along the way.</p>\n<p>The most important rule? Don’t touch your model–ever.

Dive into the specifics in this enlightening article put together by our Content team.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/understanding-the-differences-between-commercial-editorial-photography/\">Understanding The Differences Between Commercial &amp; Editorial photography</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",
      "content": "\n<p><small><em>Main photo: <u><a href=\"https://500px.com/vicente_concha?utm_campaign=Licensing&amp;utm_source=iso.500px.com&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=CommEditorial\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vicente Concha</a></u></em></small></p>\n<p>Like you, we’re passionate about photography and want to find a place for every photo in our collection. So, in an effort to remove any guesswork on your part, we’re going to take a second to lay out some guidelines and simplify the submission process.</p>\n<p>One of the most common points photographers struggle with is understanding the difference between commercial and editorial photography—more specifically, what content is considered safe for commercial uses, and what is restricted to editorial-use only?</p>\n<p>Here’s a simple breakdown for you…</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/295116155/m%3D900/v2?sig=9684cfc1acc926cea4c2fdf44a337378f7f8cac0e7faad20f75218b51f11787d\" alt=\"Active senior couple with bike helmets standing outdoors in front of a house. by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/295116155/Active-senior-couple-with-bike-helmets-standing-outdoors-in-front-of-a-house-by-Jozef-Polc\" alt=\"Active senior couple with bike helmets standing outdoors in front of a house. by Jozef Polc on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What’s a ‘commercial’ image?</h2>\n<p>Commercial or creative images are used to promote a vast range of products and services worldwide. These images communicate an aspirational concept or idea, making them a powerful tool for advertising. </p>\n<p>Because the images are almost always used for promotional and marketing purposes, we have to tread carefully where issues of privacy, permission, and trademark infringement are concerned—meaning that all recognizable people and protected/private property <b>must be</b> released if they are the primary focus of the image (or can be made to be). Logos and branding should also be avoided whenever possible, or otherwise retouched out of the photo entirely.</p>\n<p>It’s important to keep in mind that the question is not whether a person is recognizable to you, but whether they are recognizable to themselves. Even people who are silhouetted or partially obscured may be able to recognize themselves based on contextual details such as location, clothing, or the other people around them. To learn more about working with model releases, check out <a href=\"http://bit.ly/500pxReleases\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>The same applies to locations and properties that are privately owned (<b>Note</b>: just because a location is open to the public doesn’t mean it is public property). When in doubt, ask a representative of the location about any commercial photography restrictions they have in place.</p>\n<h3>Examples of commercial use include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertising in print and digital media campaigns</li>\n<li>Marketing and promotional materials</li>\n<li>Corporate presentations and brochures</li>\n<li>Commercial websites</li>\n<li>Product packaging</li>\n<li>Film and television</li>\n<li>Books and book covers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any exceptions for commercial use?</h3>\n<p>Recognizable people and privately owned locations that are the sole focus, or make up a significant part of the image, will always require a signed release for commercial licensing. Likewise, copyrighted logos and branding should always be avoided or removed unless you have prior consent to feature that brand.  Of course, as with any rule, there are exceptions…</p>\n<p><i>Crowds</i>: model releases may not be necessary if your photo depicts a crowd of organically grouped people and no individual person or small group of people can be singled out. </p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Additional info</b>: The context matters too so you need to determine a few details first; is it a big or little crowd? was the crowd organically formed as it would be in a busy street market, or is it an organized group of tourists, friends, or family? Is the crowd featured in the image or just a small part of the photo?</p></blockquote>\n<p><i>Logos</i>: similar to crowds of people, when there are many different logos in a photo and no particular brand is featured or highlighted in any way, the risk is substantially lower.</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Additional info</b>: Take into account that many brands are owned by the same parent company, so even when there are various different logos, the majority could all belong to the same corporate brand (<b>i.e.</b> The Coca Cola Company also owns Sprite, Fanta, Schweppes, Dasani, and Minute Maid).</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/287560513/m%3D900/v2?sig=570e34c2d8c937d7d698a76b9bcccf088822478ff6ec44f9d4c7910d58b8d252\" alt=\"Two female friends meeting in Tokyo by fabio formaggio on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/287560513/Two-female-friends-meeting-in-Tokyo-by-fabio-formaggio\" alt=\"Two female friends meeting in Tokyo by fabio formaggio on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What’s an ‘editorial’ image?</h2>\n<p>Editorial photos document real-life issues, current events, and stories of human interest across the globe in a truthful manner. They are used as an effective way to strengthen newspaper and magazine articles, blog posts, and other written commentaries by lending visual context to a story.</p>\n<p><i>Editorial photography photos should be relevant and meaningful and engage readers by illustrating newsworthy subjects such as business, politics, travel, culture, sports, and entertainment. </i></p>\n<p>Since the vast majority of people and places depicted in editorial images are not released, they are not suitable for promotional use of any kind—they can be used in a journalistic or informative way only.</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Additional info</b>: Bear in mind that unreleased photos aren’t automatically considered editorial, so it’s important to be realistic and establish whether or not your photo displays enough context to be used in an article about a specific news event, place, or person! Photographs of people should be engaging and convey a clear context or story. Pictures of non-descript (but identifiable) people in generic locations are of little or no worth to editorial buyers.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Examples of editorial use include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Newspaper and magazine articles</li>\n<li>Editorial features</li>\n<li>Blog or website (for descriptive purposes)</li>\n<li>News broadcasts</li>\n<li>Documentaries</li>\n<li>Textbooks</li>\n<li>Essays and journals</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any exceptions for editorial use?</h3>\n<p><i>Children</i>: due to the sensitive nature of photographing children and minors, photos of children on their own must communicate a very clear  message of cultural or socioeconomic importance. Pictures containing a group of kids are generally okay, but all images will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p><i>Ticketed events &amp; locations</i>: taking photos of an event or inside a location that charges an admission fee will almost always require permission, even for editorial use, due to the intellectual property they protect. Many of these events and locations are restricted to accredited members of the press so it’s essential that a press pass, property release, permit, or contract issued and/or signed by an authorized representative of the organization is uploaded with your submission. You can find a downloadable copy of the 500px standard property release <a href=\"http://bit.ly/500pxPR\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Examples of ticketed locations and events:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Museums</li>\n<li>Art galleries</li>\n<li>Pro sporting matches</li>\n<li>Theatre performances</li>\n<li>Concerts and music festivals</li>\n<li>Conventions</li>\n<li>Trade shows</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Do I need descriptions and keywords?</h3>\n<p>Because of the manner in which editorial photos are used, keywords and descriptions must describe the image faithfully and not be misleading. Unlike commercial photos, including product or brand names as keywords is encouraged, as long as they are truthful to the subject matter.</p>\n<p>Descriptions are intended to provide context so it is critical that they are informative and detailed (<b>i.e.</b> a photo showing a famous building holds little value for editorial buyers if the architect’s name and location of the building are not included).</p>\n<h3>What about creative filters and artistic treatments—are they allowed?</h3>\n<p><b>No</b>. To be credible and maintain truthfulness, editorial images must reflect the subject matter in a way that is honest and factual. Slight adjustments in colour, contrast, exposure, etc., are acceptable, but modifications that alter the context of your photo are considered misleading and inaccurate.</p>\n<p>This includes cropping, use of filters such as HDR, or digitally manipulating the photo in any way.  Even sepia is a no-go, it doesn’t alter the physical facts but many people use sepia toning to imply age for a vintage effect which changes the context.</p>\n<h2>Let’s compare</h2>\n<p>The most important thing to remember is that it’s all about context and how the image can be used. If you’re still unsure, take a look at these examples of editorial and commercial versions of the same subject.</p>\n<h3>Example 1</h3>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/106906011/m%3D900/v2?sig=114a568cebb0b6d63cbc8b66d70bcf6c8bdaf982b2d5905d50a96df3a45ecaa5\" alt=\"Colors of Us by Devesh Tripathi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/106906011/Colors-of-Us-by-Devesh-Tripathi\" alt=\"Colors of Us by Devesh Tripathi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><br><b>COMMERCIAL</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Signed model release</li>\n<li>Staged portrait</li>\n<li>Commercial concept</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/154239963/m%3D900/v2?sig=ede2644cfe2c5ad4df8a18439db731770afbf0c1eb8e354b1a042571f43e4a0d\" alt=\"Hare Krishna by Siddharth Setia on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/154239963/Hare-Krishna-by-Siddharth-Setia\" alt=\"Hare Krishna by Siddharth Setia on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><br><b>EDITORIAL</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>People are not released</li>\n<li>Candid and spontaneous moment</li>\n<li>Iconic and cultural event</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example 2</h3>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/303863311/m%3D900/v2?sig=a9034c8714424a8e9071b269d8dce576e977efcba3a84ff4880d25ff9867aa29\" alt=\"Female hand holding a phone, black screen by Oleksii Hrecheniuk on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/303863311/Female-hand-holding-a-phone-black-screen-by-Oleksii-Hrecheniuk\" alt=\"Female hand holding a phone, black screen by Oleksii Hrecheniuk on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><br><b>COMMERCIAL</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All models have given consent and signed a release</li>\n<li>Logos have been avoided</li>\n<li>Positive business concept</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/275287915/m%3D900/v2?sig=30c13121483e8ea42d03066425ffc0d8ec8df9b70dc3a98af575dceff16cf853\" alt=\"Hector watching YouTube by Peter Nieman on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/275287915/Hector-watching-YouTube-by-Peter-Nieman\" alt=\"Hector watching YouTube by Peter Nieman on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><br><b>EDITORIAL</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No model releases</li>\n<li>Apple logo is still visible</li>\n<li>Relevant subject matter: technology, communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>You Might Also Like These Articles:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/from-planning-to-post-a-step-by-step-journey-through-an-editorial-photo-shoot-with-clay-cook/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>From Planning To Post: A Step-By-Step Journey Through an Editorial Photo Shoot With Clay Cook</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/lightroom-workflow-editorial-photographers/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Lightroom Workflow For Editorial Photographers</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/before-after-post-processing-a-glamorous-editorial-portrait-plus-5-top-tips/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Before &amp; After: Post-Processing A Glamorous Editorial Portrait (Plus 5 Top tips)</u></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/understanding-the-differences-between-commercial-editorial-photography/\">Understanding The Differences Between Commercial &amp; Editorial photography</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>From the “flamingo” to the “bambi,” the last year has brought us a wide array of “trendy” poses adopted by celebrities and influencers. Some stuck around for a few months, and others have left a lasting impression. </p>\n<p>At the same time, today’s photographers continue to look to history, employing classic poses that have been used by some of the biggest names in the business, from Edward Steichen to Richard Avedon. </p>\n<p>These days, fashion and portrait photography are a mix of old and new poses that are constantly being reimagined. For some, these poses can become a vehicle for self-expression and reinvention. </p>\n<p>Here’s a quick look at just sixteen of the most interesting and dynamic female poses gracing the pages of magazines and the walls of art galleries. </p>\n<p>As with our “male poses” companion article, these poses aren’t just for women! Poses can be tools for expressing femininity and masculinity across all genders, so we encourage mixing-and-matching to find what poses work for you. </p>\n<p>As you draw up your shot list, feel free to pull from traditionally male and female poses, find moments of overlap, gender-bending, and experimentation, and see what works best in conveying your artistic point of view. There are no rules here. </p>\n<h2>The jump</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/84188775/m%3D900/v2?sig=dd4dc2a8ad3c10e8c925d052a72d01f12f24ece32dcc55e2aa1426e42251c2ec\" alt=\"Pennon by Dave Hynes on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/84188775/Pennon-by-Dave-Hynes\" alt=\"Pennon by Dave Hynes on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the 1950s, portraitist Philippe Halsman photographed everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Audrey Hepburn to Sophia Loren—all mid-jump. When people jumped, he discovered that he was able to capture moments of genuine joy and playfulness, and that principle still holds today. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/150188659/m%3D900/v2?sig=b60406d2245891fa9cab0adb8e8e2ed6d9ee36336ac3c0d631ecb0eefd44f2b8\" alt=\"Elle Luna by Michael O'Neal on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/150188659/Elle-Luna-by-Michael-ONeal\" alt=\"Elle Luna by Michael O'Neal on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>While jumps can be challenging to get right, they usually pay off. Just remember to use burst mode to capture those split-second moments; it might take your model a few times to get it right, so don’t be afraid to play and experiment. Ask her to pay special attention to keeping her hands and face relaxed, as they can clench up or become tense mid-jump.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there’s no one way to execute a jump pose; you can go for long, outstretched arms and legs like Hepburn or tuck your knees like Monroe.</p>\n<h2>The turn-around</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/286809701/m%3D900/v2?sig=31246f3cfb1ec6685d05fa429f8382fa5ef1c1c61a0e86b37310baf72c2aae8c\" alt=\"Obsession by Ilya Blinov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/286809701/Obsession-by-Ilya-Blinov\" alt=\"Obsession by Ilya Blinov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Believe it or not, the back-to-the camera trend dates all the way back to the turn of the 20th century, when it was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/08/06/429341622/the-back-story-a-photo-trend-from-the-1890s\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">all the rage</a> among actresses and starlets. Scholars believe this might have been an early version of the classic glamor shot, and it’s stood the test of time for its playful and mysterious sensibility. </p>\n<p>Like many of the poses on this list, there are a number of variations. Since the beginning, some have experimented with photos that focus solely on the back, while many others have preferred to add a coy look over the shoulder. You can even set up a mirror in front of your model so that we can see her face and the entirety of her back at the same time. </p>\n<h2>The hair-swish</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/227737839/m%3D900/v2?sig=c49bbe4005704df4ce2e55ede91dbd7d422d3aefeb4ddcdb723f34838375e16b\" alt=\"Summer heat by Alex Oancea on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/227737839/Summer-heat-by-Alex-Oancea\" alt=\"Summer heat by Alex Oancea on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your model has long hair, use it to your advantage. By having her turn in circles or introducing a fan into the equation, you can get tons of different shapes. Remember to use a quick shutter speed or burst mode, unless you’re going for that pretty, intentionally blurred look. It doesn’t have to be your standard hair flip, either; it can be subtle or playful, exuding a spontaneous, impromptu vibe. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/128031377/m%3D900/v2?sig=d01dd1b8c01e3ed32b37d4b6b92f117e415acd39c13284ef54f46a04f47eabc3\" alt=\"Weightless by Monica Lazar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/128031377/Weightless-by-Monica-Lazar\" alt=\"Weightless by Monica Lazar on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The criss-cross</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/149649135/m%3D900/v2?sig=ac3cda1a67732a2d1601a046af10fa11b71b462054f18dac4fde0807c047d265\" alt=\"Guess Who by Kincara Photography on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/149649135/Guess-Who-by-Kincara-Photography\" alt=\"Guess Who by Kincara Photography on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This pose is a good one to start with because it’s simple and easy to do. Have your model stand up, either on her own or against a wall, while crossing one leg in front of the other. Often, that simple gesture will create a nice shape that’s more dynamic than your typical standing-straight pose. </p>\n<h2>The curb</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/302547191/m%3D900/v2?sig=94963f8c34126f372baa21f0ef5e1635805229056dab615d1e16d171879525b7\" alt=\"Downtown by Amanda Diaz on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/302547191/Downtown-by-Amanda-Diaz\" alt=\"Downtown by Amanda Diaz on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This classic pose has been used by everyone from Richard Avedon to Bill Cunningham, and it’s perfect for conveying a sense of movement. Ask your model to stand on a curb or stairs (step ladders work nicely too) and step off to get that forward momentum. Keep an eye out for long legs and compelling angles/triangle shapes. </p>\n<h2>The s-curve</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/302930237/m%3D900/v2?sig=f47abe9f7540a2981ca9d5900bfd94982a5115e14efbe61e4edfbea13e983ea8\" alt=\"Lara by S H ?

H A N on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Historically, photographers have used sharp, clean lines to express masculinity and soft, smooth curves to convey femininity. If you want to go for curves, one way to get them is to ask your model to “pop a hip”; this gesture will cause her other knee to bend slightly. This pose can work especially well when your model is positioned at a 45-degree angle for some added depth. </p>\n<h2>The tuxedo</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/140528417/m%3D900/v2?sig=2b992337ea01e7873b816e2b74eee2b3cb13ffb93129bd2b418e8f99a9914a53\" alt=\"Geometry by Efim Shevchenko on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/140528417/Geometry-by-Efim-Shevchenko\" alt=\"Geometry by Efim Shevchenko on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This pose doesn’t require an actual tuxedo; we’re just borrowing the name from Yves Saint Laurent’s “Le Smoking” tuxedo suit, which caused quite a sensation when photographed for French <em>Vogue</em> by Helmut Newton. </p>\n<p>The original 1975 <a href=\"https://www.foam.org/museum/programme/helmut-newton\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Le Smoking</em></a> photo, featuring the actor Vibeke Knudsen posing in Rue Aubriot, offered a radically new take on femininity, one characterized by clean, minimalist lines and an androgynous aesthetic. </p>\n<p>Though it has since undergone many iterations, this pose boils down to a few basics. Have your model tuck one hand in her pants pocket while jutting one foot forward and leaning backward slightly. No cigarette needed. Bonus points for sleek, geometric clothing and androgynous, slicked-back hair. </p>\n<h2>The elbow-bend</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/82705517/m%3D900/v2?sig=6f6023a85993450e5a5a5e05c66b60db50752412b7582f2930c9e82bc5139045\" alt=\"Lilo's Gilets VI by Cornelius Loruenser on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/82705517/Lilos-Gilets-VI-by-Cornelius-Loruenser\" alt=\"Lilo's Gilets VI by Cornelius Loruenser on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many photographers adhere to an “if it bends, bend it” policy for more curves throughout the body. For more definition and dynamism, have your model bend her elbows away from her body to create negative space and shapes around her. </p>\n<p>You almost always want to have at least some separation between the limbs and the torso. Your model can do this by placing her hands on her hips or behind her head; she can also mix it up by putting one hand up high and the other down low, creating a different kind of s-curve. </p>\n<h2>The leg-pop</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/270095869/m%3D900/v2?sig=eb6579f196212935c126ae10de5791b59a477ad257ed9ebaac5f3282949c306f\" alt=\"The Garden Eden by Carlos Alexander Photography on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/270095869/The-Garden-Eden-by-Carlos-Alexander-Photography\" alt=\"The Garden Eden by Carlos Alexander Photography on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember when Angelina Jolie’s right leg became a trending topic after the 2012 Oscars, all thanks to that Atelier Versace gown and her signature “leg pop”? You can choose to go subtle or dramatic with this pose, depending on how far you extend the leg and bend the knee. It’s ideal for highlighting the length of the leg and giving it a sculptural appeal. A pointed toe is also a must, and, of course, the thigh-high slit is optional.  </p>\n<h2>The hand-to-eye</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/236107369/m%3D900/v2?sig=2f1d1038e9b2ccc34c1152e52d1201fb944c31e31d066948e911925e6650d6f9\" alt=\"DS176 - Sara beauty by Dariane Sanche on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/236107369/DS176--Sara-beauty-by-Dariane-Sanche\" alt=\"DS176 - Sara beauty by Dariane Sanche on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hands can be used on the face in a variety of ways, but one of the most effective is to use them to draw attention to your subject’s eyes. You can do it with one hand or both to frame the face; the legendary portrait photographer Platon used this technique in one of his unforgettable pictures of Michelle Obama. </p>\n<p>A quick note about eyes: try not to have your model look at you through the corner of her eye, as this will minimize the iris and give you lots of white space in the eye. Instead, have her eyes follow the same direction as her nose for big, full irises with nice catchlights. </p>\n<p>If you want to draw attention to the lips instead, move the hands and fingers down. This pose works best when the hands are photographed from the side and in a relaxed pose, since you want the fingers to look long and defined. Keep the touch light and delicate (ever heard the phrase, “ballet hands”? That’s what that means). </p>\n<h2>The dress-drop</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/160128923/m%3D900/v2?sig=f86ca28b4892b6c5bde67b10ada42e8af5d6df2ef876def36f93d1092c78217a\" alt=\"sunset and poppies by Marco Bernardi on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/160128923/sunset-and-poppies-by-Marco-Bernardi-\" alt=\"sunset and poppies by Marco Bernardi on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your model is wearing a dress, use it to create some flowing lines and shapes. To get that billowy look, you can have your model lift the fabric and let it fall to the ground, or you can ask an assistant to do it for her. Even if your model’s not moving, your photo will still have a sense of movement and momentum. </p>\n<h2>The shoulder-pop</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/240087747/m%3D900/v2?sig=17c73b0409106e936528a526a5c232169c23c4f675c7b54c0fd00bfa49e63f34\" alt=\"EFFECT by Francis At on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/240087747/EFFECT-by-Francis-At\" alt=\"EFFECT by Francis At on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This one’s popular in commercial beauty photography because it helps add that extra emotional frisson to close-ups. Ask your model to lift one shoulder and let the other one relax; it works best if her head is facing in the direction opposite the raised shoulder. You can also have her pop it slightly forward for some added depth. </p>\n<h2>The squat</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/305703523/m%3D900/v2?sig=acc38200de588aaccab3b231d68ea7ef085ac6933413bb2ab3b4d6a428df3ae7\" alt=\"unknown pleasures 05 by ducnoise on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/305703523/unknown-pleasures-05-by-ducnoise\" alt=\"unknown pleasures 05 by ducnoise on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today, you can find this pose everywhere from celebrity Instagram feeds to the Grammys red carpet, but chances are it developed its roots in early hip-hop culture, documented in photographs by legends like Jamel Shabazz. It works well for hip, fashion-centric shots with a laid back vibe, and there are several ways to do it, so have some fun with it and see what works. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011771488/m%3D900/v2?sig=2effa4209ca88ac64f0d9de9dd06c65c9ef169c79176707f11bd8fd2be50a601\" alt=\"Futuristic editorial shoot by Montè Papers on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011771488/Futuristic-editorial-shoot---by-Mont%C3%A8-Papers\" alt=\"Futuristic editorial shoot by Montè Papers on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The stool</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/205052057/m%3D900/v2?sig=28bff23cad8b005bd5803b8f349ab14d4f35f3326c495bf5ae2e1e2eb22dcd45\" alt=\"Nigella by Nicholas Ray on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/205052057/Nigella--by-Nicholas-Ray\" alt=\"Nigella by Nicholas Ray on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>While this pose can work with chairs, a backless stool or bar chair is ideal because it’ll give your model more freedom to move around. Without a back to lean on, she’ll be able to lean forward and backward and engage her body for a more active posture. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/191306453/m%3D900/v2?sig=a92350485f0096d32e69393a2d80768b43cc425540282bd890c147d22c4a1723\" alt=\"Heck Yeah! by Ben Sasso on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/191306453/Heck-Yeah-by-Ben-Sasso\" alt=\"Heck Yeah! by Ben Sasso on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your stool has steps, even better; ask her to rest her feet on different layers for a more compelling shot. Remember to keep an eye out for her hands; she can use them to grip the stool, touch her thigh, or adjust her hair. The important thing is that they’re engaged. </p>\n<h2>The Marcia</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/64206311/The-red-Queen-by-Maja-Topcagic\" alt=\"The red Queen by Maja Topcagic on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/64206311/m%3D900/v2?sig=1f5e93c086824857e763499fa44e999327b42d1091d525e69e146726768273f5\" alt=\"The red Queen by Maja Topcagic on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1015630750/Outside-by-Lisaweta-Wlasenko\" alt=\"Outside by Lisaweta Wlasenko on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1015630750/m%3D900/v2?sig=4f1fa1d08b6e0561abf84ef9be9838685a168066c6485a05fb90902e176375f9\" alt=\"Outside by Lisaweta Wlasenko on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The “Marcia” isn’t a technical term for this pose; we just borrowed it from William Eggleston’s iconic 1975 portrait of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/william-eggleston-untitled-c-dot-1975-marcia-hare-in-memphis-tennessee\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Marcia Hare</a>. To get the look, ask your model to lie on her back and with her arms spread like wings. Though Marcia’s portrait was taken more than a century ago, this pose has a timeless appeal, especially if you’re tapping into a dreamy, nostalgic mood. It’s also one of those poses that looks natural and spontaneous. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/221981865/m%3D900/v2?sig=52262549768178b2b3709790dc5021145fc0b21708341da4b5335127cebb9ca3\" alt=\"Dunja i Lara by Luana Muški? on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/221981865/Dunja-i-Lara-by-Luana-Mu%C5%A1ki?\" alt=\"Dunja i Lara by Luana Muški? on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>From this pose, your model can move into tons of different lying-down poses, extend her arms above her head, or roll over onto her stomach and prop herself up with her elbows, <em>à la</em> <a href=\"https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/83.421/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isadora Duncan</a>, photographed by Edward Steichen.

Dramatic poses look good in silhouette because you can see the dynamics of the human body; static poses don’t often look good in silhouette because they lack form and definition. When trying out new poses, check to see if they work in silhouette; it’s a trick used frequently by fashion photographers. </p>\n<p>Of course, this is by no means an exhaustive list of poses, and we recommend creating an ongoing “inspiration folder” full of poses you love. You can include tear sheets from magazines and photos you find on 500px; any time you see a unique and compelling pose, you can add it to the pile and draw from it for future shoots. </p>\n<p>Even more important than your poses is the rapport you build with your subject. Make sure she feels comfortable and free to experiment, and check-in with her throughout the shoot to see if she has any ideas. It can also help to ask her to bring some of her favorite music. Instead of asking her to hold the same pose for long periods of time, let her move around and try out new things; she might surprise you in the process. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sample-female-poses-photographing-models/\">16 classic and unique poses for photographing women</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

I was 12 when I picked up a camera with the intention of taking photos just for myself. My first camera was only around two megapixels and attached to my smartphone. I was initially looking for drawing inspiration on the website DeviantArt, when I stumbled upon the most beautiful portraits I had ever seen. I was surprised to find out that many of them were self-portraits. All of that creativity and dedication inspired me to start taking photos of my own. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019487711/11-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"11 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019487711/m%3D900/v2?sig=9866d37c062b73425c4c17bd8f211c7bc9f585e272b8a1d9b126f71b5586a774\" alt=\"11 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Many of your self-portraits present intimate close-ups, shadow play, and obscured faces. What kind of mood or themes do you try and work into your photos?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I like to make my self-portraits look like movie stills, so I try to experiment with as many different moods as I can throughout a shoot. I was obsessed with cinematic storytelling even before I understood what it was, so I try to incorporate it into my work as often as I can. As for the obscured faces, that’s my way of looking like a different person without dramatically changing my facial features! </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018568982/warmer-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"warmer by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018568982/m%3D900/v2?sig=c09190ad46b8ad35b0952aa3e69290f4c356d1d201c0889493475e1224c6afc3\" alt=\"warmer by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: For photographers looking to master the self-portrait as you have, can you give us your top three tips?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Use your smartphone camera to quickly get an idea of what you look like in different kinds of lighting. Not every camera has a flip screen. Mine doesn’t. (I use a Canon 5D Mark II.) It’s important to be aware of your best angles and poses, and one of the easiest ways to achieve that is to use your phone or look at yourself in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Understand that there will be many non-photogenic days. I’ve been doing this for over 11 years, and I still feel I look like a potato sometimes. We’re not meant to look perfect 24/7, and it’s okay if your flaws are visible in your photos. Also, try not to compare yourself to other self-portrait artists or people in general. I think this genre can easily become a beauty competition, which is obviously unhealthy. Embrace your body and your face. Focus on telling a meaningful story.</p>\n<p>Use a tripod and a remote. I don’t focus manually when I take self-portraits because that would take way too much time. A remote and a tripod will make your photoshoots much, much easier to handle, especially if you’re a beginner. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019732272/IMG6725-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"IMG_6725 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019732272/m%3D900/v2?sig=eb214219ce7de54b44b352c045303d93259c31ba25dc28516b3a5cf24e0d7d0f\" alt=\"IMG_6725 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Would you consider yourself a creative or artistic person beyond photography? Do you feel other forms of art you work with inspire you in your photography?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Definitely! I don’t take photos every single day because I know I’d get tired of it very quickly. My true love is acting. That’s probably why I’m drawn to so many different industries! I simply can’t get enough of one thing. When I don’t feel like taking photos, I have a whole bunch of creative hobbies that I obsess over. I play guitar and piano, write fictional stories, draw, paint, and the list goes on… </p>\n<p>I get a lot of inspiration from other communities, too. Sometimes I collaborate with writers, photographers, or people with interests completely different to mine. For example, I’m currently working on a song inspired by a short poem. It’s a very short poem, but the meaning and depth behind it encouraged me to come up with a full song of my own.</p>\n<p>These interests often give me photography ideas and allow me to appreciate the art of creativity in all of its forms. All of these things are linked to one another in some way, which I think is so beautiful. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: When going on a shoot. what’s your go-to camera and lens set up, and do you have another camera you aspire for?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I’ve been using the same equipment for years. I use my trusty Canon 5D Mark II, a Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens, a remote, and a tripod. Before that, I used a Canon 60D. I’d love to upgrade to the Canon 5D Mark IV at some point, and of course, I’d love to own a digital Hasselblad one day! To be honest, I wish I could experiment with every camera out there to find the perfect one.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019861141/pretty-please-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"pretty please by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019861141/m%3D900/v2?sig=da64c0119bb73f988bd0542f9941885b2a51815fad3075b4f06fa19c84771a45\" alt=\"pretty please by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Your portfolio also features another recurring model, your adorable cat, Mimi. What is your process for working with animals in photography?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Mimi is an incredible little model. She’s actually quite calm, so it’s not that difficult to take sharp photos of her. My biggest struggle in this genre is getting decent photos in low light. She’s usually very active at night, which is the best time to take photos of her. Taking sharp photos in low light can be difficult, so I try to use artificial light and bump up my ISO quite a bit. </p>\n<p>As for the process in general, it tends to be quick and simple. Most of my shoots with Mimi tend to last anywhere from 10-15 minutes. I’m usually in a weird position, trying to take as many photos as possible. I like to distract her with toys and treats. I’ll hold a treat right above my lens to make it seem like she’s staring right at the camera. My back and shoulders usually hurt afterward from all the movements, but it’s so worth it!</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1017866951/suspicious--by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"suspicious  by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1017866951/m%3D900/v2?sig=2fe9f4fb0817fb35a7b05bebd1edfdca8639727d71d32f1031412446cbe70b73\" alt=\"suspicious  by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know that you’ve mentioned before that you believe strongly in “the power of potential”; could you elaborate on this philosophy for our readers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> In my opinion, we as photographers (and as humans in general) can find potential anywhere. Perspective matters a lot here. I’ve lived in many different places throughout my life and have always found something interesting to photograph in all of them, no matter how cramped they were. Even the dullest building in your neighborhood has the potential to become an incredible background, subject, or foreground. You just have to give it a chance to shine in its own way.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/197824119/Silent-song-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"Silent song by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/197824119/m%3D900/v2?sig=a3692d1b605e584ecc55a60a0375249e10213f682288b6a504c58e640fa61771\" alt=\"Silent song by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Some of your photos such as this <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/197824119/Silent-song-by-Taya-Iv/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one</a> feature double exposures, what kinds of themes or feelings are you trying to evoke with these kinds of photos?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Double exposure photography gives me the chance to tell multiple stories at once without making my photos look overwhelmingly busy. As far as themes go, shoots like that tend to be very spontaneous. I’ll usually take a few photos of my silhouette and merge them with other photos I’ve taken in the past. Sometimes I’ll use other people’s work. Unsplash is my go-to when it comes to free stock photos. </p>\n<p>As I edit, I tend to realize that I had a specific theme in mind all along, but that it wasn’t something I could put into words. I’m not sure if that makes a lot of sense. I have noticed that I gravitate towards themes like humans and their relationship with nature and self-care.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019732273/IMG6798-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"IMG_6798 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019732273/m%3D900/v2?sig=8800ab5daa1e457a546b8ae05a91c9be15e72153d6c4ec8433cdcafe59f0f7c4\" alt=\"IMG_6798 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: At 500px we think of photographers as a community, is there any advice another photographer has given you that you feel greatly improved your work?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The best piece of advice I got was when I was just starting out as a photographer, I was struggling a lot with finding my own style and felt that I’d never be able to create anything unique. On top of that, I was frustrated because the photos I was taking didn’t look even remotely as good as my favorite photographers’. It was this vicious cycle of longing and a little bit of dread.</p>\n<p>A photographer, <a href=\"https://500px.com/p/laurakokfotografie?view=photos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Kok</a> (still one of my favorite photographers to this day), told me this: “You don’t need to be like every photographer that you like. Find what you like the most about them and use that in your work, but don’t try to be them.” </p>\n<p>I’ve paraphrased a little, but that’s basically what she said. I think this advice can be applied to any aspect of our lives. To this day, I take little bits and pieces from every artist that I like without directly comparing myself to them. It helps me have a healthy relationship with my work and gives me the opportunity to challenge myself in the process. I’m very grateful for Laura’s advice and for the wisdom of photography communities in general. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1019861136/IMG6011-by-Taya-Iv\" alt=\"IMG_6011 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1019861136/m%3D900/v2?sig=d2a11729e2ee42ca6a1278064c6cf893e219f788f636bd296708f2e48f5294be\" alt=\"IMG_6011 by Taya Iv on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Q: As a 500px Ambassador, and someone who regularly hosts deep discussions with others within the photography community, do you feel the shared knowledge of the community has helped improve your work in any way?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! First and foremost, being a 500px Ambassador is a major source of motivation for me. I’ve been a fan of this community for a long time. Mike Monaghan initially re-introduced me to it by featuring my work in Editors’ Choice a while ago. That alone inspired me to be more active in the community.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, 500px really stands out because it’s exclusively photography-oriented. I love that its users are so welcoming and open-minded. When you feel accepted as a photographer, you’re more inclined to take great photos.

      "content": "\n<p>Over the last two years, there have been a few high-profile cases involving camouflage prints on clothing; in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/kanye-west-is-being-sued-over-a-camouflage-print\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2018</a>, an outdoor company sued a major fashion brand over the use of a camo pattern, and again in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/28/783551079/montana-company-sues-fashion-giant-over-copyrighted-camo-print\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2019</a>, a Montana company sued a New York streetwear brand, also alleging copyright infringement. </p>\n<p>As camouflage has taken over the fashion world, it’s also posed some tricky questions about intellectual property. Patterns can be copyrighted, and as much as these rules affect clothing companies and designers, they also influence photographers who license their work for commercial or creative use. </p>\n<p>When browsing photos to use in their own marketing, companies must steer clear of any references to other brands or designers, including a print on a jacket or bag. As a result, commercial Licensing platforms like 500px—and its distributors—can’t accept photos with recognizable camo patterns. These restrictions protect the photographer, the distributor, and the client from any potential legal claims brought by the person who owns the copyright for the pattern.  </p>\n<p>“Camouflage is one the most common reasons for an otherwise great photo to be declined from Licensing,” the 500px Content Team tells us. “There are obvious things to avoid in commercial stock photography—like brand names and logos—but there are also more overlooked Intellectual Property issues. These are issues like phone back camera designs, side buttons, the Adidas 3-stripes on clothing, and more—but the most commonly overlooked of these is camouflage.” </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1018066823/Army-Fairy-by-Junior-Asiama\" alt=\"Army Fairy by Junior Asiama on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1018066823/m%3D900/v2?sig=e88f2a5c0c5b99eda52eab22f4791901a4d0a0220108d05b2ae199982f674576\" alt=\"Army Fairy by Junior Asiama on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.gettyimages.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Getty Images Intellectual Property (IP) Wiki</a>, an evolving database of potentially problematic landmarks, architecture, artworks, and more for commercial photographers, lists camouflage under both the ‘artwork’ and ‘product’ sections. One reason is that many camouflage prints are based on copyrighted photographs; in cases like these, you’re unlikely to be able to secure a property release, so it’s best to avoid them altogether. </p>\n<p>As with any rule, there are some situations where photos featuring camouflage might be licensable, such as those rare cases where a property release is feasible. If you collaborate with a local designer who created the pattern and holds the copyright, for instance, you could always ask them, as the rightsholder, if they’d be willing to sign a release. Explain that you’d like to re-license the images through a stock photography platform, and consider offering discounted prints for their lookbooks or ads in exchange for their written permission. </p>\n<p>If you don’t know the rightsholder and only realized that your model was wearing camouflage after the photoshoot, it doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t license any of the photos. It just means you have to get creative in post-processing to avoid infringing on someone else’s intellectual property. The first and easiest way to do this would be to crop out the pattern entirely, if you can pull it off without ruining the photos. </p>\n<p>You can also use the clone stamp tool to distort or manipulate the pattern itself. Take a small sample to clone, and alter the pattern as you wish. Camouflage patterns might seem generic, but if the manufacturer or rightsholder would be able to identify it in your photo, it won’t be accepted for commercial Licensing, so take your time to ensure the original print is unrecognizable. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, you might select the blur tool to handle problem areas and render them unrecognizable as camouflage, but remember to use a light touch so it’s not obvious you’ve edited the photo. A subtle field or lens blur can take care of camo prints in the background (say, on wallpaper), given that they aren’t in focus and aren’t your main subject. The trick here is making sure the photo doesn’t look blurred or altered, as that could lead to the image being rejected for technical reasons, so only use it when appropriate. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/62793549/backpack-by-Alexander-Rybakin\" alt=\"backpack by Alexander Rybakin on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/62793549/m%3D900/v2?sig=481224a3972715d9811d5e9d58feb93792549269da48433fd3924a96355113a7\" alt=\"backpack by Alexander Rybakin on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, the best solution is to avoid camo prints <em>before</em> your shoot—rather than spending time obscuring them <em>after</em> a session. With most commercial shoots, even a casual one at home with family and friends, you’ll have the freedom to help style your models in outfits that work for Licensing. </p>\n<p>Consider developing a style guide for new models with a basic list of do’s—e.g., solid neutral colors, clothing without branding—and don’ts, including logos, heavy patterns, and, of course, camouflage. Send it over as a PDF, and field any questions your team might have. Models can always send you photos of garments they’d like to wear and get your thoughts. </p>\n<p>You can always ask them to bring a few different options to change into for variety; if something won’t work, you’ll have alternatives. Check out our article <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/style-for-commercial-shoots/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to style your model for a commercial shoot</em></a> for ideas of what works and what doesn’t—and some resources to add to your toolkit. </p>\n<p>Commercial photographers help define our culture’s biggest trends, including those within the lifestyle and fashion industries. Recent trends—such as art deco designs, bright florals, and camouflage—have understandably found their way into the world of commercial stock photography. But many of these patterns are protected by copyright, so while they might make for great photos, they can also lead to image rejection if you’re not careful. </p>\n<p>One way to combat this problem is to interpret trends rather than simply following them. Instead of literal camouflage, for instance, you can allude to the popular style using colors and textiles. The Content Team tells us, “Items like canvas army hats, canvas bags, and solid color fatigues can all help build the military aesthetic for photographers specifically after that look, though all labels, brands, identifying names, and numbers should be removed. Using the army green color in a shoot can also be a great way to subtly connect to the same themes that camouflage provides.”</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/181106163/soldado-fotografo-by-SdelCampo-\" alt=\"soldado fotografo by SdelCampo  on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/181106163/m%3D900/v2?sig=cfc10d5265ea41ba286236419cc499237ea24890217f05b7cd40351393c51a6f\" alt=\"soldado fotografo by SdelCampo  on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, solid colors are a safe bet for commercial photography. Colors can be copyrighted—Tiffany blue and Louboutin red come to mind—but these are exceptions to the rule. If you’re looking to mimic the effect of camouflage, look for earthy greens and browns. You can combine them in a single outfit or style each model in different colors for some variety. </p>\n<p>Before any shoot, it’s good practice to check out <a href=\"https://wiki.gettyimages.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Getty Images Intellectual Property Wiki</a> to see if any product or design you want to use is protected. If you’re unsure, stick with simple, unbranded clothing. One benefit of approaching shoots in this manner is that you end up with images that are both trendy and timeless—and that appeal to a wide variety of image-buyers. </p>\n<p>By keeping your styling somewhat generic—using a few key colors rather than a specific pattern—you not only avoid intellectual property issues, but you also keep your photos practical enough to be downloaded over and over again. In commercial Licensing, that kind of longevity is often the mark of a strong portfolio. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?

      "content": "\n<p>While photos of male models were once limited to underwear ads with six-pack abs, the field is changing—for the better. With major brands turning to street-casting and alternative modeling agencies, photographers now have more freedom to experiment with how they portray male individuality and masculinity. </p>\n<p>Masculinity is complex and multi-faceted; it means something different for everyone. These days, there’s more to photographing men than the muscle-flexing cliché, and men don’t have to fit a certain mold to steal the spotlight. </p>\n<p>Below, we’ll look at just twenty-one versatile male poses to get started with when photographing men. These are all foundational poses, with several possible variations. They come from photo history and the worlds of fashion and portraiture, but they’re also modern and fresh. </p>\n<p>Add variety by shooting these poses in vertical and horizontal formats; get close for detail shots, and then move away for full-body shots. Have your model move his head toward and away from the camera to see what works; even slight shifts can have a significant effect. </p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that these poses are by no means reserved for men only. They’ll work with women, non-binary, genderqueer, two-spirited individuals, and more. We chose these poses because they can be vehicles for expressing masculinity in many different forms. They are meant to broaden your horizons—not limit them. </p>\n<h2>The hands-in-pockets</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/230800449/m%3D900/v2?sig=2f3a88b5ca95e3e27d9635d98c49936b21af36d65c62d6c411f645f6677fdd2b\" alt=\"Mistor Photoshoot Fall 2017 / Salmon Wall by Toni Hukkanen on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/230800449/Mistor-Photoshoot-Fall-2017--Salmon-Wall-by-Toni-Hukkanen\" alt=\"Mistor Photoshoot Fall 2017 / Salmon Wall by Toni Hukkanen on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the first questions new models ask is, “What should I do with my hands?” The classic hands-in-pockets pose is one way to solve this problem. You can have one hand or both hands in the pockets, depending on the look you want, but make sure the thumb is hooked outside the pocket. That way, the hands won’t look like they’re disappearing or cropped. Of course, this pose can also be combined with other poses on this list for tons of variety. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/272093237/m%3D900/v2?sig=16532906dbe01ef5144ae711fe1c294112de077717d59508b28476e7c3a73d97\" alt=\"hind sight is 20 20 by stina kennedy on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/272093237/hind-sight-is-20-20-by-stina-kennedy\" alt=\"hind sight is 20 20 by stina kennedy on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The arm cross</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/241900425/m%3D900/v2?sig=1040f086ed5c37e7be70a1118f70698bc9fce6282159d8155b741193f51f3268\" alt=\"marcel grubenhelden by Lucas Coersten on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/241900425/marcel-grubenhelden-by-Lucas-Coersten\" alt=\"marcel grubenhelden by Lucas Coersten on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>You know this one; it’s the pose you’ll find on professional directories and profile pages the world over. It’s also easy and simple, especially for men who might not be used to posing professionally. Depending on the facial expression, this pose can evoke all sorts of moods, from businesslike to edgy and non-conforming. Like the hands-in-pockets pose, this one can be combined with several others, so feel free to try it out in different situations. </p>\n<h2>The wardrobe adjustment</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/245423365/m%3D900/v2?sig=51f4324da37b4a36ac8e71fad5f04415026fe9b6de128c8951f80fd403defac9\" alt=\"JODY by Drago Tomianovic on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/245423365/JODY-by-Drago-Tomianovic\" alt=\"JODY by Drago Tomianovic on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>We’re not talking about a literal wardrobe adjustment here but something more subtle. To give your model something to do with his hands, have him roll up his sleeves, adjust his cufflinks, fix his tie, pop his collar, or touch his watch or cap. Another popular one? Holding the labels of his suit with his hands. For fashion photographers, this pose serves two purposes; first, it helps create a relaxed, casual atmosphere, and second, it draws attention to the details of the outfit. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/174870453/m%3D900/v2?sig=f6ff67ad8e2037a855606e521bfffe72440c2e5fb5f2dd3802c15fd97a356758\" alt=\"Kadeem by Sean Pollock on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/174870453/Kadeem-by-Sean-Pollock\" alt=\"Kadeem by Sean Pollock on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The lean</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/196036857/m%3D900/v2?sig=008b8b5d0039a9ec6a5337082740cd27da6824b42790e266cf371a95ca9ddc1b\" alt=\" by Mariana Souza on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/196036857/-by-Mariana-Souza\" alt=\" by Mariana Souza on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>For a relaxed, expressive portrait, have your model lean against a wall. You can have him lean to the side or straight back. You can also ask him to lift one leg and push it against the wall for a casual vibe. Feel free to experiment with angles here, as walls give you lots of options for bent limbs and sculptural compositions. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/211117249/m%3D900/v2?sig=842f6e22b9b02709d569ea6cb44bf07100c62005a647e5c9cdc7befa118ca7cf\" alt=\"Street Blossom by Edward Grant on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/211117249/Street-Blossom-by-Edward-Grant\" alt=\"Street Blossom by Edward Grant on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This one isn’t a single pose but several! Try out different perspectives, and invite your model to look at the camera, and away from it, for some variety. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/127835007/m%3D900/v2?sig=842cc1cafabe6bfc4fbaa31b41970fbfd01b1a859d28df624aa922b5ec614caf\" alt=\"Piece of mind. by Jeff Szzabo on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/127835007/Piece-of-mind-by-Jeff-Szzabo\" alt=\"Piece of mind. by Jeff Szzabo on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This technique was also a favorite of the legendary fashion photographer and portraitist Irving Penn, who sometimes used moving walls while posing his subjects. In the case of Truman Capote and Marcel Duchamp, he included walls on either side of the body, so feel free to get creative. </p>\n<h2>The strut</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/248030591/m%3D900/v2?sig=f6b8bf53a7b11d73acb89f61c57ef43947cd12d6795bb58d1cd506d22a39054d\" alt=\"francisco. by ANDRÉ JOSSELIN on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/248030591/francisco-by-ANDR%C3%89-JOSSELIN\" alt=\"francisco. by ANDRÉ JOSSELIN on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your model’s having trouble loosening up in front of the camera, have them walk towards you from a distance. That sense of movement will make for dynamic images and get rid of any stiffness your subject might need to shake off before getting into other poses.  </p>\n<h2>The jacket toss</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/138832983/m%3D900/v2?sig=cf00fdbd5c5e1887bad1a8507a4b871c36b5983e2547cc4cc6b3dceeeea83ee9\" alt=\"Francis Bacon by PANDADA on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/138832983/Francis-Bacon-by-PANDADA-\" alt=\"Francis Bacon by PANDADA on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>You’ll find this pose in fashion magazines and editorials, and it works with a model who’s standing still or moving. For a “nonchalant,” casual-cool vibe, have your subject use one hand to drape his jacket or sweater over his shoulder; if he’s walking, you can get some nice flowing or billowing clothing at the same time. </p>\n<h2>The hair-swipe</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/280683159/m%3D900/v2?sig=deee9bb5d952dbb9d65e6944a689d8fb37a421c5f5ef32e09793c934181fdd37\" alt=\"serge by Vinnie Azbergh on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/280683159/serge-by-Vinnie-Azbergh\" alt=\"serge by Vinnie Azbergh on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Have your model run his fingers through his hair for a relaxed, spontaneous feeling. You can also ask him to move his arm down and place his hand on the back of his neck for a similar yet distinct pose. These are two favorites among fashion photographers, and you’ll find them across ads and editorials worldwide.  </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/257149823/m%3D900/v2?sig=f777faf747e109340c042f4884aff7f15da7456ce1a637af0d1b21a15b9d811e\" alt=\"Jass by Aleksandra Lemke on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/257149823/Jass-by-Aleksandra-Lemke\" alt=\"Jass by Aleksandra Lemke on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The hand-to-chest</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/229961245/m%3D900/v2?sig=55aa82789d754384787f0ffbd76dcb593e98cd95edb476d78c6cdd9ac73e2cee\" alt=\"Condolence by Gabriel Gomez on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/229961245/Condolence-by-Gabriel-Gomez\" alt=\"Condolence by Gabriel Gomez on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This versatile pose can be used to express introspection and vulnerability, self-confidence and poise, and everything in between. Simply ask your model to place one hand on the opposite shoulder or chest. This easy movement will create interesting lines and angles—plus an added layer of depth. You can also have him hold onto something, like an article of clothing. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/296030315/m%3D900/v2?sig=df8140e62f409dc6b23f10e978fca84af979bb3d7cfacdf166e1f344fc68c9df\" alt=\"Dmitrij by Elena Slyusar on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/296030315/Dmitrij-by-Elena-Slyusar\" alt=\"Dmitrij by Elena Slyusar on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2><em>Contrapposto</em></h2>\n<p>Meaning “counterpose” in Italian, this is a pose that borrows heavily from art history, with one of the most famous examples being Michelangelo’s <em>David</em>. To achieve this pose, ask your model to lean his body weight on one straightened leg, bending the other leg and letting his upper body twist slightly off-axis from the hips for an asymmetrical but balanced look. Unlike standing straight, the contrapposto pose conveys dynamism and liveliness; recent studies even suggest that it could make us look more attractive. </p>\n<h2>The hand-on-hip</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/275124113/m%3D900/v2?sig=9d5771282f23fff841babeb0179aacb8ee56c466dc860bab1e8cddf25ebe05fe\" alt=\"IMG by Vicoolya and Saida on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/275124113/IMG-by-Vicoolya-and-Saida-\" alt=\"IMG by Vicoolya and Saida on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The hand-on-hip pose is usually associated with women, but like any pose, gender stereotypes need not apply, and it can work just as well for men. </p>\n<p>Just think of Yousuf Karsh’s indelible photo of Winston Churchill, where the Prime Minister stands with one hand on his hip and the other on the back of a chair. It’s the portrait of a lifetime, and it’s not just that incredible facial expression that made it unforgettable—though that certainly helped. </p>\n<p>To get the look, make sure you’re positioned slightly below your subject’s eye level. Another hint for an authoritative expression? Follow Karsh’s lead and go for a furrowed brow and narrow eyes, rather than wide-open ones. </p>\n<h2>The prop</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/178497525/m%3D900/v2?sig=b2b03c8441a8b0caa911b33c839fc0801a3869a7b6429c135bf583f40ee4a112\" alt=\"*** by Andrey Zharov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/178497525/-by-Andrey-Zharov\" alt=\"*** by Andrey Zharov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Props can work wonders, but they have to make sense within the context of your photoshoot. That is to say, they should help tell the story of the person you’re photographing, rather than distract attention away from him. It can help to ask your model to bring an object of personal significance on set; not only will this prop help make him feel more comfortable, but it’ll also help prompt new pose ideas. </p>\n<h2>The jawline</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/161801389/m%3D900/v2?sig=37b55fe9e8d9763f724c0310b9df545eef8304b6139e6c438618a91fd0b70380\" alt=\"Stefano by Edoardo Lavagno on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/161801389/Stefano-by-Edoardo-Lavagno\" alt=\"Stefano by Edoardo Lavagno on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Historically, portraits of men have trended towards hard lighting and contrast, which is great if you want to accentuate the jawline. In this case, remember to ask your model to jut his chin forward and down, as this position will result in that nice strong shadow on the neck. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/109411257/AFIEDOFIE-by-Afie-Dofie\" alt=\"AFIEDOFIE by Afie Dofie on 500px.com\"><br><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/109411257/m%3D900/v2?sig=834523b503f7715d634e91b3425c9c8f385e20e1b3952eb54c7911e278445fc9\" alt=\"AFIEDOFIE by Afie Dofie on 500px.com\"><br></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>That’s not to say that you can’t use softer light; there are no rules here. Traditionally used for portraits of women, soft light can produce beautifully dreamy, ethereal pictures of men as well; it just won’t accentuate that jawline in the same way. </p>\n<h2>The lean-in</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/128801959/m%3D900/v2?sig=928b65bf2ca6c461f752e416480593fbe82b792d6ca5afd370d18ecdec8e0978\" alt=\"Raalon .1 by Danny Owens on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/128801959/Raalon-1-by-Danny-Owens\" alt=\"Raalon .1 by Danny Owens on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not to be confused with “the lean,” this pose occurs when the model is sitting, with his arms on his knees. If you want to make it a classic “power shot,” position your camera just slightly below the subject’s eye level. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/239179017/m%3D900/v2?sig=de670ac7d3379e2092a924dabb083edaf66f7058c3e5338b34c16e8c7c0bb655\" alt=\"Phil by Sollena - Photography (Sandra) on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/239179017/Phil-by-Sollena--Photography-Sandra\" alt=\"Phil by Sollena - Photography (Sandra) on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The thinker</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/201880179/m%3D900/v2?sig=5724a9a04405fb572989e838aa26f29c9114d5182f56aa11503a77be70cf342b\" alt=\"Per Kristian by Kristina Lang-Ree on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/201880179/Per-Kristian-by-Kristina-LangRee\" alt=\"Per Kristian by Kristina Lang-Ree on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>We borrowed the name of this pose from the famous sculpture by Auguste Rodin, but it can also be traced throughout photo history; one photographer, Alvin Langdon Coburn, even modeled a portrait of George Bernard Shaw after the sculpture itself. In this pose, the model is seated, with his chin on his hand and elbow on his knee. It’s a pose associated with thoughtfulness and heroism, so it works well for serious portraits. </p>\n<h2>The leg-cross</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/171082607/m%3D900/v2?sig=57f73274e34889b110fe3850f67c43d5f345b78b68dc76708618cef230dd7469\" alt=\"Sunday Reads by NIK on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/171082607/Sunday-Reads-by-NIK-\" alt=\"Sunday Reads by NIK on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Crossing your model’s legs can add dynamics and a sense of movement to almost any photo, no matter the pose. Still, one of the most common leg-cross poses you’ll find includes a seated model with the ankle of one foot resting on the knee of the other. This pose can be done on a chair, bench, or sofa for a natural, candid feel. </p>\n<h2>The backward chair</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/280821681/m%3D900/v2?sig=60bb33ad709548b1b7b6452638d6032358f5edb2cbfcc5c3c332f93f1a35d7a9\" alt=\"Still not smiling by Petar Tutundziev on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/280821681/Still-not-smiling-by-Petar-Tutundziev\" alt=\"Still not smiling by Petar Tutundziev on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This classic pose can be found everywhere from senior portraits to album covers (think: Lionel Richie in <em>Can’t Slow Down</em> or Johnny Mathis in <em>Feelings</em>). It works well because it conveys the same sense of self-assurance as the “lean-in” while also giving you some added versatility. Have your subject lean onto the back of the chair or rest his hands there for a cool, casual sensibility.</p>\n<h2>The face-touch</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/179488291/m%3D900/v2?sig=a07dfc0bf48fd402f186c3db0d62e5d16a088412f8602086fd30ac3fcf0021f2\" alt=\"Ha Ha Funny by Tamarcus Brown on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/179488291/Ha-Ha-Funny-by-Tamarcus-Brown\" alt=\"Ha Ha Funny by Tamarcus Brown on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Use the position of your model’s hands to direct the eye, and play with hiding and revealing different portions of the face. A touch can be used to demonstrate strength, vulnerability, or both. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/197759527/m%3D900/v2?sig=6844eae878437884e90481d9b202323487dd0a5da1b929510df96459afbc3107\" alt=\"Portrait by Grigoriy Ivankov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/197759527/Portrait-by-Grigoriy-Ivankov\" alt=\"Portrait by Grigoriy Ivankov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>A hand to the chin, as in Albert Watson’s iconic photo of Steve Jobs, will tell a different story than a gentle hand on the cheek, so check in to see what your model likes and go from there. Asking your subject to touch his face can also result in candid, natural facial expressions that are difficult to “fake.” </p>\n<h2>The hand-clasp</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/130466915/m%3D900/v2?sig=2673bee0c20008e833d1e64e6011eed3ec06d8f4a87b64b569b22f80ee623c75\" alt=\"Anton by Klara Fowler on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/130466915/Anton-by-Klara-Fowler\" alt=\"Anton by Klara Fowler on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This pose, usually executed when the model is sitting, can exude humbleness and approachability. As with the “lean-in,” you’ll have your model place his elbows on his knees—only this time, you’ll ask him to join his hands. You can also do it standing up, if your subject is leaning on something like a railing. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/217631251/m%3D900/v2?sig=445edcea138b2e5e78cb404cda910f46b410095f4c294f821ee65bc8ee31b7e9\" alt=\"_3247 by Sean Lawrence on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/217631251/3247-by-Sean-Lawrence\" alt=\"_3247 by Sean Lawrence on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can also use this time to get some close-ups of the hands, which can often help tell someone’s story even better than the face. Your model can also draw attention to any rings or tattoos he might have. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/228681849/m%3D900/v2?sig=8ab680a160db400bb0c811782a5b56ad432bdd0f0808d0df37f17946b0344606\" alt=\"Crop tattooed man outside by Konstantin Kolosov on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/228681849/Crop-tattooed-man-outside-by-Konstantin-Kolosov\" alt=\"Crop tattooed man outside by Konstantin Kolosov on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The stairs</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/124658179/m%3D900/v2?sig=e2bcd78f6e849f72a960a2dea5492dea3ad777db8df7826cefa7d2be103f1ef6\" alt=\"Stairs by Matthias Wiebersinsky on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/124658179/Stairs-by-Matthias-Wiebersinsky\" alt=\"Stairs by Matthias Wiebersinsky on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stairs are perfect for portrait and fashion shoots because they allow for different levels and perspectives.

Have your model lean back, with at least one of his arms behind him, propping him up. He can also place his elbows on the floor, rather than his palms, but it works both ways. </p>\n<p>Like many of the poses on this list, this one comes off as relaxed and comfortable, giving your photos an authentic and spontaneous vibe. He can lean back on both hands or leave one free and move it around. He can cross his legs for an added point of interest, or he can bend one leg and extend the other—your call. </p>\n<h2>The “in-between”</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/196485327/m%3D900/v2?sig=c4ad9f8ded54f42d7022d0b364e787748cfff584d6f562cb7d4a93ef80fe0e7c\" alt=\" by www.AndreLPerry.com on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/196485327/-by-wwwAndreLPerrycom-\" alt=\" by www.AndreLPerry.com on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This isn’t a pose per se, but it’s just as important as any conventional pose. The “in-between” refers to the natural poses your model makes when he’s in between formal poses; it could be as simple as turning over his shoulder to look at you or dancing to the music when he thinks you aren’t shooting. </p>\n<p>The breaks between traditional “poses” are all opportunities to grab some candid, off-the-cuff poses and gestures that are unique to your model. These are the poses that can’t be planned or choreographed, so take advantage of these moments. </p>\n<p>These poses are just a starting point, and we recommend staying open to improvisation on set. There are hundreds if not thousands of other poses to explore, so we’ve barely scratched the surface here. Your approach will also vary based on the person you’re photographing—what works for one face and personality might not work for another. </p>\n<p>Take the time to get to know your model and understand what he wants from the session, and remember to provide encouragement and feedback throughout the shoot. Posing and direction should always be positive and fun. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet? <a href=\"https://500px.com/signup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to explore more impactful photography.</strong></p>\n<p><b>You Might Also Like These Articles:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/a-beginners-guide-to-photography/\"><u>A Beginners Guide to Photography | the Essential Guide</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/creative-self-portraits/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>50 Creative Self-Portrait Ideas To Trump All Selfies</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sample-female-poses-photographing-models/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>16 Classic and Unique Poses for Photographing Women</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/posing-guide-ideas-couples-photography/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>50+ Adorable Couple Poses for Beautiful Portrait Photography</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/35-mobile-photography-tips-thatll-help-you-take-incredible-smartphone-shots/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>35 Mobile Photography Tips For Taking Better Smartphone Shots</u></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/sample-male-poses/\">21 Poses to Try When Photographing Men</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\">500px</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Portrait photography experts inspire us to take better shots. Looking for new photographers to follow? Great! We’ve got a set of Top 10 lists in the works that’ll help you do just that. We’ll work our way through the major categories of photography — from wildlife, to landscapes, to street photography, to portraiture, and beyond — listing out 10 of our favorite 500px photographers in each genre.</p>\n<p>The lists are by no means exhaustive, of course (there are many more than 10 incredible photographers on 500px for each of these genres), so don’t hesitate to drop names and links we forgot in the comments!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So far, in our quest to share some of our favorite creators on <a href=\"http://500px.com/\" target=\"_blank\">500px</a>, we’ve given you 10 must-follow photographers in both the wildlife and action/sports photography genres. Adrenaline spiked and heart pumping, it’s time to slow it down a bit and venture down more intimate roads. Specifically, it’s time to discover some incredible portrait photographers.</p>\n<p>This list was, in many ways, more difficult to curate than the first two. Portrait photography is a broad category — does family photography count? what about babies? does it all have to be headshots? — which had us more than a little worried.</p>\n<p>In the end, we decided to try and stick to portraiture in as pure a form as possible. The closer to the headshot, the better. Single people, not groups. Basically, photography where creative framing, expression, and processing choices drive the exposure, not things like background or clothing.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p><img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/90555385/m%3D900/0a17f10b4f79c98d93603ce6bd18edba\" alt=\"Portrait photographer - Photograph Raining again by Sam PortraitsBySam on 500px\"></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/90555385/raining-again-by-sam-portraitsbysam\">Raining again by Sam PortraitsBySam on 500px</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is, of course, not an exact science. Which is why we encourage you to fill in gaps we left! Think we should have included <a href=\"https://500px.com/LisaHolloway\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa Holloway</a> or <a href=\"https://500px.com/JessicaDrossin\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Drossin</a> or <a href=\"https://500px.com/portrait\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Woloszynowicz</a>? Feel like some of the names on the list below don’t match the criteria above? That’s what the comments are for!</p>\n<p>And if you don’t agree with the full list, we invite you to go exploring through the 500px community. Dig up unknown names and drop them in the comments, publish your own must-follow list, and then send it to us and ask us to republish it! Together, we may just be able to cover all the bases.</p>\n<p>For now, these 10 incredibly talented bases will have to do. Enjoy!</p>\n<h2>Amanda Carlson</h2>\n<p>Amanda is originally from the Chicago area but currently lives in Seattle at the moment. Her dad gifted her with her first 35mm film camera when I was in high school and shared his own photography stories, like how he got his first camera when he went to the Vietnam War. I was fascinated and took my first film class when I was 15, then later became a photojournalist at my university newspaper, which got me interested in people and street photography.</p>\n<div

As with color, shape, and cropping, juxtaposition can become a key component of photographic compositions, helping to tell a story and emphasize differences or similarities between objects or people. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/301723491/m%3D900/v2?sig=9d5626bec1091551aeae2a9455254f95eb4ee7873a681dc6108b5346665f4a76\" alt=\"?????????Our portrait of blue? by Jey_X on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/301723491/????????Our-portrait-of-blue-by-JeyX-\" alt=\"?????????Our portrait of blue? by Jey_X on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1003653472/m%3D900/v2?sig=97e9c7023d38c17853f25bb44a25d602a3f1e06c8a83452212f9af9f234e15da\" alt=\"obsession by Sergey Fett on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1003653472/obsession-by-Sergey-Fett\" alt=\"obsession by Sergey Fett on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>At its simplest, juxtaposition is about using comparisons to spark emotions, resulting in that “aha!” moment that so many of us seek when looking at photographs. It boils down to the element of surprise—a secret “inside-joke” between the photographer and the viewer. </p>\n<p>Beyond that, juxtaposition is a theme that spans genres, from street photography to landscapes. Below, we’ll take a look at some exciting and unexpected examples of juxtaposition within the 500px community. </p>\n<h2>Big versus small</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/289476399/m%3D900/v2?sig=a49c75dc339a1915f09b2e855773b4163d15afb04889d812993b04f98d9e7f17\" alt=\"?? by ?? on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/289476399/??-by-??-\" alt=\"?? by ?? on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the most common uses of juxtaposition is to convey a sense of scale (e.g., #tinypeopleinbigplaces). The French street photographer <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/henri-cartier-bresson/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a> did it all the way back in the 1930s; in the empty streets of Tuscany, the Royal Gardens of Paris, the stairways of Cyclades, Greece, human figures appear as small as ants, dwarfed by the cities and landscapes around them. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1007996438/m%3D900/v2?sig=7aa421790c6035ff6df81f94eb9bb2b8c22ba009fccf9dba387a3f79c5e8aee2\" alt=\"Bride by Laurynas Butkevi?ius on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1007996438/Bride-by-Laurynas-Butkevi?ius\" alt=\"Bride by Laurynas Butkevi?ius on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In more recent years, these big-versus-small juxtapositions have spoken to our collective concern for the natural world; by showing just how small we are in comparison to wild, untouched landscapes, photographers can appeal to our sense of reverence and our desire to preserve what’s left of the planet.  </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1008558075/m%3D900/v2?sig=9c4ae8bc16ae369f09dcba14c099622d4c01a367957373b394de68ce437d5b92\" alt=\"SUP by Anthony Rayburn on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1008558075/SUP-by-Anthony-Rayburn\" alt=\"SUP by Anthony Rayburn on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Near versus far</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/115205517/m%3D900/v2?sig=b37b33410b4af821ca6d3ad2e200e9ae27b9e1931a7661811d3c78ae537773b7\" alt=\"Break in a Shinto shrine by Hiroaki Kuroda on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/115205517/Break-in-a-Shinto-shrine-by-Hiroaki-Kuroda\" alt=\"Break in a Shinto shrine by Hiroaki Kuroda on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This one goes back to the forced perspective trend we touched on earlier; any photo that uses proximity to make a subject appear larger or smaller than it is, is an example of forced perspective. It works particularly well in street photography, where your position can make a person look tiny—and a dog or a cat appear huge in comparison. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/149840395/m%3D900/v2?sig=034b8598fcd8dae742626eb72cfbdda7002c10fac10bb69cfc9781a45a529b20\" alt=\"?????? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????-?? ?.?. ???????? by Rulon Oboev on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/149840395/??????-???-???????-???????-???????-??-????????-by-Rulon-Oboev\" alt=\"?????? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????-?? ?.?. ???????? by Rulon Oboev on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Similarly, a forced perspective can trick the eye into believing a child is larger than an adult. It’s a clever aesthetic technique, but it can also carry additional layers of meaning, signifying what element is most important and worthy of our attention. </p>\n<h2>Light versus dark</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1000499249/m%3D900/v2?sig=9d94921d740fdee682eb3d4435406d7df65b71389de79c8245d4de467b02b8d7\" alt=\"Sisters by Magdalena Berny on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1000499249/Sisters-by-Magdalena-Berny\" alt=\"Sisters by Magdalena Berny on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The renowned photographer <a href=\"https://pro.magnumphotos.com/Package/2K7O3RZ7T9S\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elliott Erwitt</a> is a master when it comes to juxtaposition, and his book <em>Dogs Dogs</em> is a prime example. In its pages, you’ll find several pairs of dogs—waiting for a taxi in New York City, looking out a window in New Orleans, or hanging out by a bench in London. </p>\n<p>Erwitt plays with scale a lot, but he also experiments with color. A few of the most powerful of his images feature a white dog sitting beside a black one—and that play on color is something photographers still use decades later.</p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/16622347/m%3D900/v2?sig=4eeccb51d0a5197e32648d8a910ae6369f8a09ede1bbc41500f9d22856f0eebf\" alt=\"Two salukis by Artem Sapegin on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/16622347/Two-salukis-by-Artem-Sapegin\" alt=\"Two salukis by Artem Sapegin on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, you can employ this technique when you’re working with humans too by juxtaposing light hair and dark, brown eyes and blue, etc. The possibilities abound with this one are endless. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1000309180/m%3D900/v2?sig=56bae8362673fcca91ae7591bee167e0715ed59e0105dc82f49d21b3b812327a\" alt=\"Max &amp; Kelly by Naomi Rader on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1000309180/Max--Kelly-by-Naomi-Rader\" alt=\"Max &amp; Kelly by Naomi Rader on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Human versus object</h2>\n<p>If you’ve read about juxtaposition in photography, chances are you’ve come across at least one reference to Robert Doisneau’s <a href=\"https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/29788\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">portrait of Picasso</a>, in which the artist’s hands have been replaced by loaves of bread. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011713930/m%3D900/v2?sig=f60c0969d6819a8590820d7cf254b102db0b812f611ac4a3c59cc9a9a68bb1e8\" alt=\"Watermelon MAN by KISHANSRI on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011713930/Watermelon-MAN-by-KISHANSRI-\" alt=\"Watermelon MAN by KISHANSRI on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>These comparisons between the human body and inanimate objects can be subtle and surreal, and they also pack a comedic punch. <em>Watermelon Man</em> (above) by <a href=\"https://500px.com/kishansriphotography\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kishan Sri</a> in India is a perfect—and serendipitous—example of this technique. </p>\n<h2>Right versus left</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/118605429/m%3D900/v2?sig=41cac9dfe9ef1f4bc377bb1795bb6ae2a0abd0f4d507db719d522bdac0045344\" alt=\"don't look at me by Peter Nientied on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/118605429/dont-look-at-me-by-Peter-Nientied\" alt=\"don't look at me by Peter Nientied on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>This photo (above) by <a href=\"https://500px.com/peternientied\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Nientied</a> has multiple levels of juxtaposition, from the light-versus-dark theme to the human-versus-object motif, but one of the most powerful boils down to the direction of the subject’s gaze. While the artwork she’s viewing faces one direction, she leans the other way, making for a compelling composition. </p>\n<h2>Subject versus environment</h2>\n<p>Juxtapositions in photography can be planned, but just as often, they’re the product of coincidence. The American photographer <a href=\"https://aperture.org/shop/shore-uncommon-places-revised-book/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Shore’s</a> body of work, for example, is punctuated by miraculous everyday coincidences where everything comes together: a woman’s green pants match the color of her car, a couple’s outfits echo the pale blue of a nearby building, some bags of onions are almost the same shade of orange as the truck behind them. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/230437239/m%3D900/v2?sig=7dcc2c78a4b6bcda98743a5cf612a15d8b2b590a7c10fe396718ecd4e89b068a\" alt=\"yellow and blue by Anna Degtyareva on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/230437239/yellow-and-blue-by-Anna-Degtyareva\" alt=\"yellow and blue by Anna Degtyareva on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In short, look for parallels between your subject and the setting in general. These can be colors, patterns, shapes, or all of the above. You can capture them spontaneously and on-the-fly or organize a photoshoot around your idea. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1013330187/m%3D900/v2?sig=f1960faf980f83cd4be35cbccfd8ee5aeb84cbebf613d9b44cacf1d43ec344dc\" alt=\"OTTICA by Giovesoft on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1013330187/OTTICA-by-Giovesoft-\" alt=\"OTTICA by Giovesoft on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Many versus few</h2>\n<p>The photographer <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/steve-mccurry/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Steve McCurry</a> uses this one a lot in his compositions, showing groups of people with one person who’s slightly different from the rest. Maybe it’s one person in green Holi powder, surrounded by those in red, or perhaps it’s a single fisherman in the water, right next to a group of his peers on stilts. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/265252549/m%3D900/v2?sig=41903634b3a1387bfa3753a3b81540f3d82a7ed4b9d9c4c239f76c04b8085668\" alt=\"Abbey road? by Wings on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/265252549/Abbey-road-by-Wings-\" alt=\"Abbey road? by Wings on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/198930397/m%3D900/v2?sig=243ff2fb918d588f80da32cd569bfcf0f0571e69f322f8d29f7ab4814e953781\" alt=\"Red Chillies Pickers by Azim Khan Ronnie on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/198930397/Red-Chillies-Pickers-by-Azim-Khan-Ronnie\" alt=\"Red Chillies Pickers by Azim Khan Ronnie on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>For photographers, the many-versus-the-few motif can take on different meanings, depending on the context. You can use it to explore themes like conformity and dissent, togetherness and isolation, individualism and community—or you can employ it just because it’s a beautiful visual effect. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/157131501/m%3D900/v2?sig=8e537eb6b9ba72d3c1dbe32ceaa67e7b95e24092eb8f2205f0c2cb2150f88773\" alt=\"P I N K by Eden Briand on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/157131501/P-I-N-K-by-Eden-Briand\" alt=\"P I N K by Eden Briand on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/105146385/m%3D900/v2?sig=16d2af1fc41336181cf2222fba427bbeee30baf939ff2974dca34f6de7f4f90c\" alt=\"Healthy chick by Marco Favero on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/105146385/Healthy-chick-by-Marco-Favero\" alt=\"Healthy chick by Marco Favero on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/208792545/m%3D900/v2?sig=944e75f7befbc61590b46f4d94311c53b1b33e825401270f21ac08010209b3e0\" alt=\"outsider by Juergen Kramer on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/208792545/outsider-by-Juergen-Kramer\" alt=\"outsider by Juergen Kramer on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Organic versus man-made</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/235722029/m%3D900/v2?sig=acc292eab19bb6f6ce874c50c755410e97981fb7b7714480daffd3c72499d427\" alt=\"Alone in the forest ? by Alex McKenzie on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/235722029/Alone-in-the-forest--by-Alex-McKenzie\" alt=\"Alone in the forest ? by Alex McKenzie on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2201697-destruction-of-nature-is-as-big-a-threat-to-humanity-as-climate-change/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>, humankind has significantly altered three-quarters of our planet’s land and two-thirds of our oceans. As habitat destruction and deforestation threatens our natural resources, photos juxtaposing wild and organic elements with geometric, man-made ones take on new significance. </p>\n<p>While early landscape photographers like Ansel Adams and Carlton Watkins captured the majesty of the natural world, today’s photographers are also drawing comparisons between the built environment and pristine wilderness. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/291113163/m%3D900/v2?sig=46aa1d7a1fbde47c70c017e9b089794c27680768d2fbe1f506249cd8111ce36b\" alt=\"???? by ???Aken on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/291113163/????-by-???Aken-\" alt=\"???? by ???Aken on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whether it’s through aerial images or urban exploration, they’re touching on the unexpected intersections between two seemingly disparate worlds—while also pointing to possibilities for the future of humankind (both utopian and dystopian). </p>\n<h2>Juxtaposition in facial expression</h2>\n<p>Juxtaposition in faces can be a powerful tool in portraiture. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_Twins,_Roselle,_New_Jersey,_1967\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Diane Arbus</a> taught us that when she photographed twins Cathleen and Colleen Wade in 1967; they might be identical, but when placed side-by-side, their differences are what stand out. Colleen is smiling. Cathleen is not. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011271403/m%3D900/v2?sig=9a7cb4859f7f30a37ad633528b23eee9699d60182eed004aecb4bb2cd5e95efb\" alt=\"Bored by Heather Wilson on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011271403/Bored--by-Heather-Wilson\" alt=\"Bored by Heather Wilson on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this image (above), titled <em>Bored</em>, the photographer <a href=\"https://500px.com/hwilson8\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heather Wilson</a>—who has twins of her own—does something similar. The boys are identical, and they’re wearing matching shirts, but somehow, it’s their dissimilarity rather than their likeness that catches our attention. </p>\n<h2>Reality versus photography</h2>\n<p>This one is more conceptual, but it’s also timeless. Before photography, painters used the “painting within a painting” motif to explore the thin and blurry line that separates art from life. A clear example is within the work of the surrealist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Magritte)\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">René Magritte</a>, where the boundary between the real and the make-believe tends to overlap. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/310632677/m%3D900/v2?sig=95fcf742f2152b376d175cee982b8713e1569376aa4db53db4ceae1871217644\" alt=\"Grazia FR by Marta Bevacqua on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/310632677/Grazia-FR-by-Marta-Bevacqua\" alt=\"Grazia FR by Marta Bevacqua on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because photographs are inherently realistic, they can be employed in a similar way. This portrait by <a href=\"https://500px.com/martabevacquaphotography\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Marta Bevacqua</a> juxtaposes a real face with a photograph of a face, but that’s where it gets tricky. Of course, none of it is “real” in the essential sense; the whole thing is a photograph and therefore, an elaborate illusion. </p>\n<h2>Past versus present</h2>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/250773569/m%3D900/v2?sig=50559f729132e95d148267b1b5f40b67b60555219fb04ff0ade10717e591089d\" alt=\"Street scene, Tokyo by Yoshiro Ishii on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/250773569/Street-scene-Tokyo-by-Yoshiro-Ishii\" alt=\"Street scene, Tokyo by Yoshiro Ishii on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>By 2050, a forecasted 66% of the world’s population will live in urban areas. Modern megacities can serve as a playground and muse for photographers—in part because they’re changing and expanding at such a rapid rate. </p>\n<p>In some neighborhoods in cities like Tokyo, Shanghai, Delhi, or Lagos, you can wander for hours, exploring the contrast of old versus new, in the form of architecture, traditions, and activities. While one element might convey a particular aspect of a city’s culture, two juxtaposing details can tell the story of its past, present, and future. </p>\n<div class=\"pixels-photo\">\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/1011388941/m%3D900/v2?sig=e92147e47011466bc9d786afbe85ff83a2811967e4e114497af698199065a147\" alt=\"Cotton Girl by Adi Perets on 500px.com\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://500px.com/photo/1011388941/Cotton-Girl-by-Adi-Perets\" alt=\"Cotton Girl by Adi Perets on 500px.com\"></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>As you might notice, even the most subtle juxtapositions often leave a lasting impact. Sometimes, it’s used as a visual joke or pun, and sometimes, it has a sobering effect, as in the case of photographs that reveal the disparities between extreme wealth and poverty. </p>\n<p>Regardless of whether it elicits delight, shock, or reflection, juxtaposition encourages us to “look twice” even when we’re busy scrolling through the internet. In our increasingly fast-paced world, that seems more important than ever. </p>\n<p><strong>Not on 500px yet?
